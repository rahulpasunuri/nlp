This is a two forker as written. However, if you add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, one finely chopped green onion and a dash of cayenne and let it mellow in the fridge for a few hours it rates 3.5 forks.

Very tasty. Easy to prepare. I think it needed more garlic. Be sure to taste before putting it on bread, mine needed salt badly. My 12 yr old liked it too. Didn't tell him it was eggplant..guess that makes me a wimp! But he sure liked it.

I zipped this up a bit and am glad I did. I doubled the amount of roasted garlic, quadrupled the parsley and added two tbls. of very finely diced purple onion.

Can't say I was too excited about this. I followed the directions as is, but roasted some extra garlic just in case. I ended up using all of the extra cloves and it still was rather bland. Also a bit too watery. I don't cook eggplant much, so I'm not sure if there's a way to prevent that...

Mine turned out like an eggplant dip, and it was gone in about 4 minutes. I made this for a diabetic dinner guest (and I am doing South Beach), so we spread it on sliced mushrooms instead of bread. Extra garlic and topped with buffalo mozzarella. I will definitely cook this again, only without guests so I can have it all to myself. :)

Oh Goodness, this app. was devine. It was so simple and quick to prepare and I was able to prep dinner while it was in the oven. Instead of making the toast I just used Garlic Crustini's. The eggplant was the perfect topper. Will definately use this one again.

speaking as a lover of eggplant, this dish doesn't do it justice. i made it exactly as is, and found it bland. tried to give it flavor with pomegranate molasses and sumac, then added a touch of lemon juice, and then red pepper. came out ok, i still served it to company. but honestly, there are many better ways to eat eggplant than this. baba ghanoush beats this any day.

This stuff is great! Pretty easy, but makes people think you really know how to cook cause it is soooo good! My girlfriend and I love this stuff with dinner. Make sure not to use too much oil on the toast slices or they dont really turn golden on the oiled side.

Surprising flavor -- a little garlic goes a long way. Tried melting smoked cheddar shreds instead of parmigiano for even more tang.

This is fantastic! I make it all the time when I have guests. I always make extra and keep it in the fridge for light snaking. I have also skipped the cheese and added curry instead.

Delicious, though time-consuming, but adults and children alike wolfed these down! My only regret was that they were so delicious, that everyone filled up on these and my lovely meal went almost untouched!

We loved this, more for it's different flavors than for it being an amazing recipe. It was a little time consuming for the novice cook, but it can be done in advance and then put together at the last minute. We enjoyed the flavors and it was a nice change from the tomato bruchette people are used to. I can see this being made again for other dinner parties.

The flavor is good, I added a few spice , and chopped jalapeno and La. Hot Sauce. This made it a keeper

I thought this was delicous in its simplicity. Everything was roasted slowly, creating some very mellow flavors. This is like the cute quite guy in the corner...not the boisterous blowhard.

I did not care for this at all. The texture was wet and slimy, the aromas were off-putting, and the color was not attractive. It's a rare occasion for me to have a bad experience with an epicurious recipe. I would not make this again. On the contrary, my husband said that he thought it was good, but he had had a couple cocktails prior to our eating. Ha!
