Amazing flavor, double the recipe. They went fast before i could get to eat them. Added more red pepper flakes and a tad more butter, slid them on wooden skewers for easier grilling. Perfect companion with steak.

East and tasty method of preparing cultivated mushrooms. Used a ridged cast iron pan and prepared these in doors.

I should have stuck with the mushrooms I have been making for years. Too much effort for not so great results.

It seemed that 1/4 cup of parsely to be too much, so I just added a small tablespoons full. Also decided to use ground spices and baby bellas in addition to the button mushrooms. Oh and decided against quarting them, served them whole.

This is a great, quick recipe. I did not toast the spices...used already ground and it was fabulous. I have made it many times for many people and it always goes over very well.

Quartered large mushrooms, placed in plastic bag,added olive oil, ground spices, shake to coat. Grill in non-stick grill wok on gas grill. Fast, easy and yummy.

Excellent! Easy! Had this with grilled beef tenderloin and an arugula salad with red wine vinaigrette. Would definitely make it again and perhaps try Schlesinger's original recipe as well.

This was incredible! Very easy too. I used the ground spices and skipped roasting them and still the flavor was awesome. I put them with the skewered shrimp and saffron pistachio rice...bit hit!
