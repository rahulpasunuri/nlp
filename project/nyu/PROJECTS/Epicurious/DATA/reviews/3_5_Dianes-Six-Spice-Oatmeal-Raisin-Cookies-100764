Eh, I keep *wanting* to like these, as I love rich spice mixes and unusual combinations, but they really taste off. We are calling them Diane's odd-spice cookies. The cumin is really strong in them, and they leave you wanting something sweet. If I was to make them again, which I almost certainly won't, I would sub 1/2 teas more cinnamon for the cumin. As is, the texture is nice, but the flavor is YUCK!!!! Also, the spice flavors are so dominant that you lose other great flabors like butter, oats, and raisins.

I took these phenomenal cookies into the stratosphere by adding chopped candied ginger, cardamom, doubling the cayenne, and also adding a bit of kosher salt atop each one.

Rating: 4
These are good but if I make them again, I will reduce white sugar and brown sugar to three-quarters cup each. They're a little too sweet. Also I think my pinches of cayenne and cloves might have been too stingy. I'll add a wee bit more next time.

I loved these cookies, and so did everyone who tried them. I made them for my boyfriend who likes to have cookies and milk before going to bed. He liked them so much he forgot about his regular chocolaate chip and went for these instead. I would add a pinch more cayenne, but I like a little heat.

These cookies are delightful! Since I am baking for someone with a milk allergy, I substituted Saffola margarine for the butter, and they still turned out great. (Now I want to try with the real stuff to see how much better they are!)

Delicious. A wonderful variation on the same old oatmeal cookies. I up the spices a little (and chiptle chili powder makes a nice smokey addition). It's also great with chocolate chips, other dried fruits and even some unsweetened coconut shreds.

An excellent cookie, but I thought they were too sweet. Beginning with my second batch, I therefore cut the white sugar down to 1/2 cup and made my pinch of cayenne a tiny bit larger. Perfect!

These came out very nice and chewy but I found the cumin a bit overpowering. I did omit the cloves because I simply didn't have any on hand. Perhaps they would've tempered the cumin a bit, we'll see next time, otherwise I'd probably reduce the cumin a pinch or so. This made 50 cookies for me. I baked for 10 minutes. I'm also at altitude, about 4300 feet, no adjustments seem necessary to account for that with this recipe.

This probably would have been better if I had a stand mixer, but I had to mix this by hand and it was TOUGH! These cookies were dense and like rocks. I'm sure I overmixed it, but there was just not enough batter for the amount of oats used, so I'm sure it wouldn't have come out chewy, the way I thought they would. Won't be making these again :(

Rating: 4
I've long been on the hunt for the perfect oatmeal cookie. Seems they were always too thin or not buttery enough or bland. These are fantastic. Don't be afraid of the cumin--it adds a bit of unexpected depth to the flavors. Delicious! I'll definitely make these again and again.

I love cumin, but not for baking, but to keep things interesting I did add a smidge. I added a titch more cayenne pepper, reduced the butter by half and substituted it with 1/2 cup applesauce. I added 1/4 cup currents, 1/3 cup chopped walnuts and 1/3 cup minced crystallized ginger. I also simmered my raisins and currents for a few minutes because I like them plump in my cookies. The real test will be in a moment when I taste one ... aaaahhhh. Decent, but not 4 forks.

Rating: 4
Update! If you would prefer a more moist texture to these cookies, use cake flour (instead of all purpose), a half cup butter and a half cup shortening (instead of one cup butter), along with two eggs (instead of one). Using dark brown sugar instead of light, and using dates instead of raisins also makes for a nice change...

I have never made ANY cookie from scratch. This was easy enough and SOO GOOD! Best oatmeal raisin cookies I think I have ever had.

Rating: 4
Okay, WOW! My husband took one bite and said "wow, that's one helluva cookie". On the second bite, he said "this may be my new favorite". I followed the recipe with two exceptions: reduced the cumin to 1/4 tsp and increased the cayenne to two generous pinches. This cookie ROCKS. I think it would be a perfect accompaniment to a cup of Chai. I did grate fresh nutmeg as it said. YUM.

Rating: 4
Delicious. Following the other reviews, I adjusted the spices to 1tsp each of cinnamon, allspice and ginger, and a sprinkle of nutmeg. Other than that, I stuck with the recipe. The consistency is perfect and they taste divine. I'm in England and nervous about translating US recipes and have a some bags of imported US all purpose flour in my kitchen as our plain flour produces thinner crisper cookies because the gluten content is different. So I used the AP flour for this and am glad I did. The cookies are about 2.5 inches wide. Great with a cold glass of milk!

Rating: 2
I cut the cumin to less than a quarter tsp as previous raters recommended, and it still was overpowering. This is the first time I have ever thrown out a batch of cookies, but thanks to the cumin, they were just disgusting. The recipe does look like it has some potential to be good, without the cumin

Rating: 3
This recipe is quite good, and I'm very picky about oatmeal cookies. Many of the reviews recommend reducing the cumin, and I agree. I cut the cumin to a little over a quarter teaspoon but I recommend cutting it to a quarter of a teaspoon or less. Also, I used one stick of butter and one stick of margarine instead of two sticks of butter, and cut down a little on the granulated sugar. Added chopped walnuts, too. Took them out slightly early and left them in the pan for five minutes. Perfect! Hint: Soak the raisins in the egg and vanilla a half an hour ahead of time and your raisins will be plump and more flavorful.

Rating: 3
I halved the recipe and made a few alterations. I used Kamut flour, instead of regular flour, all brown sugar and used 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, allspice and ginger. Since I like raisins and nuts, I used full amounts, as written for a full batch. The cookies were firm and crisp on the outside and moist inside with the extra raisins. Good recipe but not a true "wow". I was not sure of the cumin and pepper. Next time, I will experiment and include all the spices.

Rating: 4
We LOVED this recipe! I have tried many... this one is chewy chewy soft 'n chewy! I did everything the same but only half of the cumin and I did half raisins, half dried cranberries.... DELICIOUS! Makes a milllion and everyone loved them!!! The spices are super yummy too, not over-powering, just right! ENJOY!

Rating: 4
Wonderful flavor---- the cumin is very subtle and the cayenne was just barely noticed. We followed the recipe to the letter and got a crunchy cookie. Next time, we'll play around with spice measurements and cooking times. This great recipe begs to be tweaked to your own (adventurous!) tastes. : )

Rating: 4
These cookies are AMAZING. I make them often and my friends at work always ask for more. Here are my two modifications: Reduce the oatmeal by 1/2 cup for a slightly chewier cookie. Be very sure not to overcook these--I recommend practically undercooking them. Remove from the oven just as the edges are starting to brown and the centers have just set. Then, let them sit in the pan for a full five minutes before removing them to cool--otherwise you'll have problems getting them onto the rack without them collapsing. This produces an extremly chewy cookie.

Rating: 4
These cookies are great! Don't fear the spices! You can even add more if you like things more flavorful. I used less than 1/2 the amount of sugar in the recipe and then added 1/4C of molasses...the cookies came out delicious! (Next time I would actually use more cumin and cayenne.) Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Delicious recipe. Took the advice of other reviewers and cut the cumin to a little over half of the suggested 1 teaspoon. A fun, easy and exotic twist on an old standard. Everyone I shared them with thought they were awesome.

Rating: 3
I loved the spice combination, but found the cumin a little heavy-handed. By reducing the cumin and ginger to 3/4 t each and putting in a little more than a pinch of chile, (about 1/4 t), I thought the cookies were still exotic, but with the spices slightly more in balance. (I also slightly reduced the sugar by leaving it unpacked. With so much spice, you don't really need that much sugar).

Rating: 4
My husband and I love this cookie recipe. I call it exotic spice cookies because they do have a unique flavor. We like our cookies chewy so divided the butter with half shortning, baked on parchment paper and used ice cream size scoops for a larger, rounded cookie. Thanks Diane for the perfect spice combination.

I can't help it - I alter everything. I used less sugar (just unpacked cups, with lots of room in the top). I used half whole wheat pastry flour and half oat flour. And I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla. I also found that in a hotter oven, they stay very thick and soft... but before it was fully hot, or on the top rack, they flattened out and got crisper. Both were great. They got rave reviews!

This is the best oatmeal raisin cookie recipe I've ever made or tasted. I'm not a cookie lover but made these for my husband. I ended up eating as many as he did. I agree with other reviews that state the cookie is a little to sweet and I think I may add more than "a pinch" of cayenne next time.

Rating: 3
I love cumin and cayenne pepper, but wondered whether they would work in a cookie recipe. They worked great. The baked cookies have just a hint of cumin flavor and the barest hint of heat in the bcak of your throat (after you finish the cookie). I made the recipe exactly as stated execpt I skipped the raisins because I was out of them. The only suggestion that I might have is to add an extra egg to make it easier to form the scoops of cookies on the baking sheet.

I have made these cookies several times. I use the basic ingredients, omit the cumin, and add whatever I want.

They always turn out terrific!

We are great Indian Food lovers, and I think the title of this recipe should be Tandoori Oatmeal Cookies. We would rather our cumin and this mixture of spices be in the form of curry, thank you very much. While we ate and enjoyed these...sort of, please note the basic cookie was excellent, moist, chewey, just the right crispy give, if carefully baked. Just next time no cumin.

Rating: 3
Have to admit, I, too, liked the steak review on this one! With cookies, one can always substitute. I used only 1 1/2 cups of sugar, spelt flour instead of regular flour, and (because my husband doesn't believe it's a cookie if it doesn't have any) a half cup of chocolate chips - excellent, chewy and wonderful combination of spices.

I was really let down by this recipe. Although I expected the dough to be stiff, I didn't expect it to be as dry as it was. The spices added a great dimension to an otherwise ordinary oatmeal cookie, but if I made them again, I would find a great oatmeal cookie recipe and just add the spices.

Rating: 3
A lovely adult cookie, using the full amount of spices. I used a cup of cacao nibs instead of the raisins, and the cookies are quite sophisticated, with a nice little crunch that is ever so slightly bitter. It's a great offset for the sweet cookie. Be sure your spices are fresh!

What else can I say that so many others have not? These were a real hit in my house, and so unusual!

I made these this afternoon and they are outstanding! I only made two changes to the recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup of Smart Balance Lite for 1/2 of the butter and used 3/4 cup of Splenda instead of 1 cup of white sugar. I used the full tsp of cumin and it seemed just right. I might add some pecans next time but the cookies are really good just the way they are!

Rating: 4
These cookies are off the hinges! I didn't have ginger or cloves, so used allspice in their place. Used whole wheat flour and reduced the sugar by almost half, as I usually do with dessert recipes. Per the suggestions from other reviewers, I used just a dash of cumin. The result was surprisingly sophisticated and subtle...a definite upgrade from your standard oatmeal cookie recipe!

Rating: 3
For those who are fans of oatmeal raisin cookies, this is a "special" version that is definitely a keeper. The mix of spices make it more savory and less cloyingly sweet. Next time I make them (and I will), I will makes these changes: 1) given the other comments, I used approximately 3/4 tsp. of cumin. It seemed just right. 2) I will increase the cayenne a bit. Also these notes: once you've added the oatmeal and raisins, mix the dough with your hands. It's the only way to get it thoroughly workable. Flat teaspoon makes small cookies; I went for half tablespoon.

Rating: 4
Used all the spices at full amounts and LOVED them. Everyone at our housewarming did to. My only comment was two days later even, they did not taste so good...as if the cumin and other pices started to fight. I would say to pop them in the freezer if you'll be keeping them for more than two days. Fresher the better.

Rating: 3
I reduced the cumin to 1/2 a tsp. because of the reviews that said it was overwhelming. I loved the results, but my partner can only taste the cumin. Next time I will reduce the cumin to about 1/4 or 1/8 of a tsp. I definitely won't leave it out altogether!

I have made these three years running and they are always a big hit. If you are looking for an ordinary oatmeal cookie with cinnamon and nothing else than go elsewhere and stop complaining about the cumin.

The first time I made these cookies I added mixed dried fruits and seeds. They were very pretty and flavourful. The cumin did stand out, which I liked, but I would imagine that not everybody would. The second time I made them I followed the recipe nearly exactly but I had no ground cloves so I doubled the amount of cinnamon to compensate. This change had the effect of really softening the impact of the cumin. The cumin still adds something to the flavour but I doubt that anyone would be able to identify it if you did not know it was there. I highly recommend these cookies and if you feel squeamish about the cumin, try increasing the cinnamon for balance.

I was paranoid about adding the cumin to these cookies. I added about half and did think that they were too "cuminy". However, I brought them to work and they were gobbled up to rave reviews. I think that I had pre-programmed myself to not like these because of the cumin. I am going to make these again without the cumin.

It is dangerous to leave me alone in the apartment with these cookies. They are delicous. Some people commented on the cumin, saying there was too much. I didn't find that to be the case at all. I smelled it more than I tasted it. Next time, I will add two (instead of one) pinches of cayenne, to give it a little more kick. I also used half the raisins, as I'm not a big raisin fan. They are so good!

One word, addictive. I couldn't stop eating these, nor could my husband. Is it the ginger, the cumin, the cayenne, the cinnamon?

Outstanding cookie just as it is. The spices are not obvious, and my cayenne pinch was very healthy, but they serve to add a very interesting base note that perfectly counters the brown and white sugars. I have made this three times and here are my tweak and tip: 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of grated lemon zest works wonders to counter the smoky sweetness of this cookie Don't let your raw cookie be too round. The level tablespoon you use to drop the cookies should be shallow, not deep. I made some with a tablespoon shaped like half a sphere and they didn't cook right. Try these cookies! If you have an adventurous palate they will become a favourite!

I've made these cookies, according to the recipe, a couple of times. I love the flavor (with the full amount of Cumin), but they're only soft out of the oven, then they turn hard and crunchy.

I made this as written except for eliminating the raisins - no one in the house is very fond of raisins in cookies. My family loved these cookies, and I admit they're very good, although I find the cumin flavor to be the overwhelming spice flavor of these cookies, and I think next time I might use half as much cumin, and see how that turns out. Mine baked in 9 minutes per batch, and spread out pretty well - not too thick or too thin. The recipe made 51 cookies for me, and I used a tablespoon measure to scoop up the dough for each cookie. I'm taking them to a party tonight, and feel like I should put a little card on their tray, saying "these are SPICE cookies." Definitely will make a unique addition to the gift cookie plates this year.

These were different and tasty. I only added 1/2 t. cumin since it was the "strange" spice, and I thought it was plenty. I would recommend flattening the cookies slightly because they don't spread much. I only baked mine for 8 minutes, and could have maybe even shaved off another minute.

Very tasty oatmeal-raisin-spice cookies. Cumin was not overpowering (but it took some trust to put it in there!) and the flavour was a lovely 'balance'. However, these came out crunchy for me; not always a bad thing, but I ususally want chewy oatmeal-raisin cookies. I will make them again, though, when crunchy is required. Good, but not a first choice.

These were the BEST cookies I've ever made!! My husband, the oatmeal cookie monster, and my kids both loved them. I believe that cayenne has natural immune system boosters, so they are healthy, yes? I did follow the reviews, cut the cumin and upped the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. YUUMMMM!

Tasty cookie. Previous viewer was correct in cutting down the cumin. It is the brown sugar that makes cookie chewy, not the flour. I replaced 1 cup raisin with 1/2 cup dried cherry and 1/2 Cup raisin. I also added 1/2 cup slivered almon. Good stuff.

Made these at Christmas as presents for my clients, now I'm take pre-Easter orders! Adults positively LOVE them! I did replace 1 cup of butter with 1 cup of butter-flavored shortening (Criso is very good). To truly appreciate the myriad of flavors, try to use organic spices if you can find them (Whole Foods or Trader Joe's). This is absolutely one of my favorite recipies!

These really are awesome cookies, especially for those who like things with a kick! I took the others' suggestions and cut the cumin to 1/2 tsp, used 1/8 tsp of cayenne, and cut the oatmeal to 2 1/2 cups. The cookies did become crunchier overnight- maybe next time I'll try cutting the flour by 1/4 c to see if this keeps them softer/more chewy, or maybe add applesauce as someone suggested. If you like your cookies crunchy, though, they're perfect! Also, I wouldn't cut the sugar since it balances the spiciness well. YUMMY!!!

This is my new favorite oatmeal raisin recipe. At the advice of others, I cut the cumin to 1/2 tsp. and cut the sugar to 1/2 cup granulated and 3/4 cup brown.

Next time, I'll reduce the sugar even more, maybe to 1/4 cup granulated and 1/2 brown.

Taking some of the previous advice, I upped the cayenne (just a bit over an 1/8 of a teaspoon), cut the cumin to 1/2 teaspoon and the oatmeal to 2 1/2 cups (I find that too much oatmeal zaps ALL the moisture out of a cookie) and the results are FABULOUS! A great combination of sweet and spicy!

following other reviewers' suggestions, i cut down on the cumin and i think next time i'll put in more - and a little more cayenne. definitely need to be bigger and softer than recommended - next time i'll use tablespoon-plus portions and bake shorter, remembering that oatmeal cookies don't long done til they're TOO done.

I just LOVE this recipe! I've made these cookies 6 times, now, and each time they are perfect--very consistent. My husband complained at first about the "savory" cumin, but now he begs me to make them at least once a week! A definite favorite in my book.

Rating: 4
I loved these!!!! So did my 10yr. old daughter. The cookies had a very "autumny" kind of taste, and they made the house smell great! I did cut back on the cumin to 1/2 a teaspoon though.

My neighbour brought these to a street BBQ and we all raved about them. I asked for the recipe and she printed it off for me and noted her substitutions. She added 1/2 cup of applesauce and decreased the cumin by half. The applesauce helps to keep the cookies soft after they cool. I've taken the recipe one step further by toasting the oatmeal before adding to the cookie dough. Unbeatable!!

Please help! What did I do wrong? They were so soft when they came out of the oven, but overnight turned really hard. I LOVE the flavor of these cookies, but what am I doing wrong? I've made them twice now, and haven't been very succesful.

these were great! I can't stop eating them! I added dried cranberries instead of raisins and used only about 2 1/2 cups of oatmeal, which made them nice & moist. My new favorite oatmeal cookie recipe.

I've made these cookies twice, and both times, I've...ahem...goofed up a bit. The first time, I forgot to add the baking soda to the dry ingredients, and had to mix it into the otherwise-finished dough. The second time, I made sure I added the baking soda to the flour and spices, and then forgot to add that whole bowl of dry stuff to the dough (sigh, don't ask!). Both times, I caught my mistake and fixed it before baking the cookies, and in both cases, the cookies came out wonderful! I consider these fool-proof. The first time, I used 3/4 cup of each type of sugar, and I think I prefer this. The second time, I used a full cup of each. One time, I used no cumin; the other time, just a tiny pinch. They were fine both ways, but I'm not eager to try it with the full or even half amount of cumin. These cookies are really addictive!

Rating: 2
After all of the positive reviews I was very disappointed. When they cooled, they were just too dry. I could not recommend this recipe.

Rating: 3
I was very excited about the unusual mix of spices in this recipe and I wasn't disappointed. It reminds me of the spicy dessert dishes found in the Southwest. I think I used a little more cayenne pepper than the recipe called for (about 1/8 tsp in a half recipe), but I like things spicy, and the cookies had just enough bite that I could feel it in the back of my throat. Fantastic!

Rating: 2
This was a quick, easy receipe although I think it had an overwhelming amount of flavor. The texture was great and if you like spices and really robust-tasting cookies, this is perfect for you.

Rating: 3
I couldn't bear to add cumin and cayenne to cookies so I just spiced them the way I like them - with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. Also, I didn't have any brown sugar so I just used all white. The cookies were simple and quick to make and stayed soft and chewy the next day. Very nice.

Rating: 3
Hmmm, the jury is still out on this one. I think the cumin is the problem here. It is just too overwhelming. I would try this again--but with a variation. I would use a pinch of cumin, for a subtle flavor rather than the primary taste. This cookie is truly different and this is enjoyable in and of itself; it is worth playing with. It has also inspired me to try an oatmeal cookie with Asian Five Spice seasoning.

Rating: 4
This cookie recipe is AWESOME! Didn't have the hot spices, so I just used cinnamon and allspice. It was still reallllly good!

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC. I modified it out of preference and necessity. I added two pinches of cayenne, since we like more heat. Secondly, I substitued chopped "cherry essence" prunes and dried cranberries for the raisins. I cannot imagine that the raisins would have even compared to the flavors of the cherry essence, which complements the spiciness. YUMMMMMMM

Rating: 4
Very chewy, almost savory, and very special (if a little too sweet to eat five, which I just did). I didn't tell my friends what went into these cookies until they said they absolutely MUST know--so I did--and they still loved it. One thing to remember when trying a new recipe is that you shouldn't expect the ordinary. If you want plain oatmeal raisin cookies, flip the lid of your Quaker oats because these are not what you are looking for!

Rating: 1
I must have done something wrong. These turned out very hard and crunchy - not how I like them. I'm supposed to bring them to a gathering, but I might just toss them. They were soft out of the oven, but overnight they hardened a lot. If there is a next time, I would use less/no cumin. I like the other spices though. I used fresh ginger instead of powdered.

Rating: 4
Reduced cumin to 1/2 tsp - terrific.

Rating: 0
I tried a variation (and still may try this): I used the technique and spices from the raisin tea cake (on this site), and cooked the raisins with those spices, and this recipe's butter, white sugar and about 1/2 cup water. Cooled and then used in with the rest. Wow, is that good (the raisins are plump and soft and flavorful). I may try these spices, but will do the same way. Great texture, too.

Rating: 3
I like to try and stay as faithful as possible to a recipe when trying it for the first time, therefore I wanted to include the cumin, but was weary due to previous remarks. I compromised and put in 1/2 teaspoon, and these turned out great.(I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup of each rather than a full cup) They have to go down as the best oatmeal raisin I've ever eaten!

Rating: 4
This is my second review of this recipe. I thought it too sweet the first time, so I left out the granulated sugar, as one other cook had done. Different cookie altogether! It was sweet enough, but the chewiness I loved so much didn't happen. I'm going to use all the sugar next time to get the original chewiness and texture--that was half of the appeal for me. But those spices are truly addictive for me. I increased the cayenne and ate so many of them yesterday that I had a stomachache clear up till bedtime. Had to take Zantac to go to sleep. I've decided the original proportions of ingredients are PERFECT!

Rating: 4
Wow, unusual, complex! A real winner for those looking for something unusual.

I took these cookies to a weekly meeting where we have cookies at the break. It was a real hit! Next time I'll try adding white pepper as one reviewer did. And maybe black pepper another time. A real keeper.

Rating: 2
From the reviews, I knew to brace myself for a strong cumin flavor, but I still thought it was too overwhelming. It seemed like a "one-spice" recipe. I'm sure I would like these a lot without the cumin, though. I reduced both sugars to 2/3c each, but would recommend 3/4c each instead. Even though I'm pretty adventurous food-wise, I didn't like this particular combination of flavors and would not make these again.

Rating: 2
Ditto the last review. Five spices would be have been ideal. Cumin is interesting and I always like to try new twists on things -- but I don't think I liked it enough to try again. (Despite the fact that my 3 year old is munching away at his cookie as I write...)

Rating: 3
I hate to be a party pooper, but I thought the cumin gave these cookies an odd, slightly "off" flavor. The texture was wonderful, the cayenne added a nice little kick, everything else was great, but the cumin tasted a little dusty. These have the texture I've been looking for, but in the future, in my kitchen, these will be known as Diane's Five-Spice Oatmeal Cookies.

Delicious and different. A keeper.

Rating: 3
Excellent. I too cut back the sugars to 3/4 cup of each and they were plenty sweet.

Rating: 3
They're different but ..interesting.. Addictive. Crispy and chewy at the same time. The whole family liked them, but they're better on the 2nd day. I used 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, but my sis thinks it's still a bit too sweet, so maybe next time I'll cut another 1/4 cup. I'm thinking of adding some chopped chocolate. Will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
We love this recipe. I have made it many times. Instead of a birthday cake I make this for my husband's birthday. The only difference is that I add 1 tsp white pepper, 1 tsp cracked black pepper and increase the cayenne pepper to 1 tsp. We love the kick as do our heat loving family and friends.

Even my sister who hates oatmeal cookies loves this recipie! I swear by it!

I have'nt gotten any complaints from thes cookies. I did not use all the spices. I only used the cinamine & freshly ground nutmege. That makes a difrence using freshly ground. I only used 2 cups of oatmeal instead of 3 because of what one reviewer said. My husband takes thes to work and sells them in packs of two $.50. He hasnt gotten any complaints so far. His complament is" thes are the best oatmeal cookies I ever had".

Absolutely delicious super-chewy cookies.

i'm not rating it cause i haven't made it yet but i'm excited about the prospect! reading the comments, i have to say that all my best cookie recipes are so "stiff" at the end of the mixing process that i have to use my hands. i would never use a mixer?!?!?! am i crazy?

Rating: 3
The texture of these cookies is good but I found that the amount of oatmeal was a bit much - the parts of the batter that ended up with a bit less in it made better cookies (to my taste anyway!). Next time I'm going to go with just 2 cups oatmeal. (I use Robin Hood brand "wild oats" - may have something to do with it.) Great taste - I like the spice mixture. "Grownup" cookies!

Rating: 3
I DO NOT like oatmeal, but inherited a bag of it from a friend who was moving so I tried out this recipe. The cookies were a hit in my office! Even I liked them. The balance of spices is just right and they taste their best when combined with a glass of fresh, cold milk.

Rating: 4
Without all the positive responses from others, I would never have tried this. I was just looking for a replacement for my mother's traditional recipe. (Get the good ones before your mom gets Alzheimer.) I had run out of my good cumin so I used Poudre de Colombo. Everyone is right. This is on the can-make-again list.

Rating: 3
I loved these! I thought the blend of spices was great. Some that I served these to thought they could do without the added "kick" in the spices. Several suggestions included eliminating the cloves and nutmeg. I liked them as the recipe stated.

Rating: 3
For those with less sweet tastes (like many Europeans), leave out the granulated sugar. I did this by accident and found the cookies sweet enough, as did everyone else who tried them. I loved the spices, which were just perfect! They were not too overwhelming at all, but gave a nice touch to sometimes bland oatmeal cookies. My dough was very stiff, so I ended up making balls and flattening them on the cookie sheet.

Rating: 4
Just the best oatmeal cookie I have ever made! I was a bit leary about the cumin and cayenne; especially since I never made them before and doubled the batch the first time. I always use old-fashioned oats. I did cut back on granulated sugar though(I used approximately 1 1/2 cups for a double batch). And yes, I was more than a bit apprehensive about adding 2 tsp. of cumin and two pinches of cayenne. Fortunately I usually go with the though of nothing ventured, nothing gained. I now have a fabulous oatmeal cookies recipe in my repertoire!

These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have ever tasted! I can't wait to make these cookies again, a real gem!

Rating: 4
This one's a real keeper. A nicely spiced, fragrant cookie that had just the right amount of flavor. I didn't even notice the subtle cayenne, and the cumin flavor was very discreet as well. Will definitely make this again. Didn't have enough butter and had to use half margarine. The cookies were still delicious.

Rating: 3
I wish I could be as enthusiastic as the rest of the reviewers but these cookies were way too sweet for my liking however the flavor of the spices was another thing altogether! It was a delicious combination though most unusual. Has anyone made them without any sugar and just fruit juice concentrate or applesauce? I found that making then on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper made a better tasting batch than just the ungreased tin.

My new recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies. I actually added another 1/2 t of nutmeg and cinnamon.

Rating: 0
These are a fantastic & fragrant treat! The first time I thought my pinch of cayenne was a little too big, and the cookies had just a bit too much bang for me. But our 3 year old inhaled them! So definitely don't omit cayenne (or any of the other spices) altogether. Also, the second time I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 margarine. Still had the great buttery flavor, but they didn't spread as flat and had a nicer texture. Love this cookie!!

i really liked these, although i confess that i omitted the cumin and cayenne. (was sending them to a picky friend and didn't want to take the risk.) next time i'll try the recipe with. these are packed with oats, making them dense and chewy, rather unlike the typical oatmeal cookie. crisp on the edges, chewy inside, and with a great butter flavor. really pretty good.

I have to admit, I was a bit apprehensive to use the cumin & cayenne, just sounded too wierd. However, I followed the recipe exactly, but cut in in half. It is WONDERFUL!!!! Chewy, but crispy around the edges. Really, don't change a thing, stick to the recipe.

I also found the cumin to be too pungent. It was otherwise a wonderful cookie. Great texture! Next time I will omit the cumin.

Mmm, I like this recipe, although I used curry instead of cumen! Next time I will try the original recipe.

Wow! These are my new favorite. I will be making these a lot. I cannot emphasize enough: DON'T leave anything out! It isn't THAT much spice, and no one flavor stands out much. Cumin is nothing to fear! The cookies are perfectly flavored and well-balanced, with an almost candy-like quality. Small, crispy at the edges and satisfyingly chewy throughout. We love these!

Rating: 4
A nice spicy cookie. I omitted the cayenne and only did 1/2 tsp cumin. I used 3/4c sugar instead of 1 cup and added 1/4c maple syrup. Next time, I'll try the cayenne. The cookie itself is delicious!

Rating: 4
Wow, what a great cookie. After reading some of the reviews, I only added 1/4 t. cumin so there was just a hint of the spice. My kitchen smelled fabulous while they baked. I also threw in 1/2 cup chopped walnuts and added a little water to the stiff batter. I will make it again with adding more cumin.

Great cookie recipe!!! Everyone who has had this cookie has said its the best oatmeal cookie they have ever had. I omitted the ginger , cumin and cayenne and added a tsp of molasses instead. My sister also added a little bit of applesauce and less sugar. Try it

LEAVE OUT THE CUMIN if you don't want that overly pungent thing going on. Add more cinnamon and cloves instead. (The cayenne is great, though.) I added a large handful of chocolate chips, and about 1/8 c. water because it seemed a bit dry. The texture is wonderful; crispy on the outside, chewy inside. A great cookie for your archives. I'll definitely make it again, without the cumin.

I gave these out as part of a Christmas cookie basket. I kept hearing "These are the best oatmeal raisin cookies I have EVER had in my life." The flavor is beyond compare, nice and punjent. The spices bring out the raisin flavor.

I like cumin but this was way too much for my taste and I only added 1/2 teaspoon. It over powered the rest of the spices. Next time I'll only use 1/4 teaspoon. I also made some other adjustments - added an additional 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg. Cut down both sugars to 3/4 cup, added 1/3 cup of molassas, and I used golden rasins soaked for 2 days in dark rum. I think it would have worked if I had cut down on the cumin more. The texture was exactly what I was looking to achieve, soft and chew. Something to try next time. If anyone else does please, let me know how it turned out.

Rating: 1
This was a truly disgusting recipe--sorry to have to say so. I made these as a thank you for someone, and I was so embarrassed. I think they would've been okay had I not put in the cumin. I even put in less than it called for and it still took over the entire flavor of the cookie. Yummy, chili-flavor oatmeal cookies -- not! If this is what "adult" oatmeal cookies taste like, then I'd rather have the taste of "kiddie" oatmeal cookies for the rest of my life.

Rating: 3
These are excellent cookies. I would have never thought cumin would add such a wonderful taste to these cookies.

Really, really good (and I'm ordinarily not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies, but my husband is.) I'd probably go with 3/4 tsp cumin next time - it definitely is the dominant spice otherwise.

THESE ARE WONDERFUL COOKIES! Definitely for the adult palate. I have made them twice and will make them again and again. Follow the recipe and include ALL of the spices. I accidentally put in 2 pinches of cayenne the second time I made these. Wow! What a kick! I lowered the oven temp to 350F and baked for 13 minutes. These cookies get crisp and crunchy when cooled. Definitely a keeper. Thanks, Epicurious, for this delightful recipe.

These are absolutely awesome cookies. I always make Oatmeal Raisin cookies at Christmas but was looking for something more jazzy . . . this is it. The folks I gave them to as gifts loved them and lots came and asked me what gave the cookies that extra "kick". I'll be making these again!

I love Indian food spices, but not in my cookies! I made this recipe twice: first time according to the recipe, which was fine except for two pet peeves: a bit too sweet, and the cumin smell & taste/aftertaste. So the second time, I put a bit less sugar (and a pinch less flour), no cumin or cayenne, and boosted the amount of ground cloves. And voila, the perfect cookie, with lots of spicey kick! I baked them bakery-store sized, which required a bit more time in the oven. Each dense, chewy cookie is a meal in itself. I would definitely make this cookie again.

Rating: 3
This is a great cookie. I will definately make this again. I also do not like cumin, although I did include it, and to me the smell of it was overwhelming when the cookies first came out of the oven. However, I didn't TASTE the cumin and I probably only smelt it because I knew it was in included in the ingredients.

Rating: 3
This recipe is wonderful. I did substitute one cup of oatmeal for one cup of chocolate chips. It was a good choice. Also, I had the cookies on 375 for about 10 minutes. Dough was a bit stiff, but the cookies turned out marvelous!

This is an exceptional recipe. Here in Washington State, community groups serve as hosts at freeway rest stops. We serve coffee and cookies to weary travelers. I have made these twice and then ran a little contest to see who could identify the spices. Had a couple of winners who figured it out. More importantly, it provoked lively conversation and sent travelers on their way perked up. Thanks for the unique combination of flavors.

Risky, but most people liked it. I wouldn't serve it alone, but I would serve it again

Very, very, sweet. 1 cup of granulated sugar, and 1 cup of brown sugar, plus 1 cup of raisens, made this excessevaly sweet, and a bad texture. Can't believe 100% approved of this. Are you sure the amount of ingredence are correct?

Rating: 3
I made these according to the recipe and was very happy with the outcome. However, I found that 375 degrees was too hot and my first batch burned on the bottoms. I lowered the oven to 350 and baked the cookies for about 12 - 14 minutes and they turned out just right. I do use an oven thermometer so I know that my oven's thermostat is okay. Next time I may even go for a bigger pinch of cayenne. The cumin is not really discernable but adds that something extra, that je ne sais quoi.

Rating: 3
I was looking for more of a basic oatmeal cookie recipe; however, this one got such rave reviews I decided to go for it. I still was pretty conservative with what I put in it. The only spices I added were 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 tsp. cumin. In addition, I didn't add the raisins. The changes turned it into a great basic oatmeal cookie recipe with just a tinge of pizzazz. Think the cumin adds some great character to it.

Rating: 4
I was skeptical of the spices at first but it makes a WOW oatmeal cookie! Definitely don't be shy about adhering to the recipe. I found the cookies were actually better when allowed to "mellow" for a day or two.

The first oatmeal cookie recipe I've ever made twice...and I intend to keep making it. I cannot! stand cumin so I skip it. I've also tried adding a little chinese 5 spice powder which is pretty good but it doesn't take much or the anise flavor gets too strong. I use at least an 8th teaspoon of cayenne and sometimes a pinch more. I think I'll head to the kitchen now....

This is the ABSOLUTE BEST oatmeal cookie recipe!!! These cookies are slightly chewy fresh out of the oven and firm up nicely once cooled. Although the dough is unbelievable difficult to stir in the end (and I'm one lazy cook!), it was well worth the elbow grease for these phenomenal cookies!!!

These are great! Not your everyday oatmeal cookie. The spices make them more complex and adult (I think some kids might object to the umph of these cookies.) I used half of the cumin called for, omitted the cayenne altogether, and used egg substitute. Soaking the raisins in a brandy might be fun...
