Easy, no-fuss dessert. I could easily throw it together while making dinner at the same time. My husband really liked it and would have given it at least three forks. I thought the crust was bland (a waste of calories, my mom would say), and the cream cheese overly heavy. But these are common complaints I have even with bakery-bought fruit tarts, so take them with a grain of salt. Just FYI: you could easily make this with half as many oranges.

Let's get these reviews back on track. This was tasty and so easy and quick. I made individual tarts and rolled the pastry in icing sugar rather than flour (a trick I learned from a head chef). The cream cheese mixture was so tasty and I too served the dish slightly warm. A touch of cinnamon on top added a lot to it and it would have been even better if I'd had any orange liquere to add to it. A great dish for when time is at a premium.

I know, I know, I know, you don't want to hear about substitutions, and normally I follow recipes exactly, but... I just don't have time to peel and slice 10 oranges, so I used three cans of mandarin oranges. It was an incredibly easy, pretty, and delicious recipe. We ate it slightly warm, and there was none left over, so I don't know how it would store.

all I can say is wow! I can't believe you other cooks talk to each other that way. I am seriously disappointed in this site, that you use it for "bantering" in such a negative way. Get a life, or just go back to the kitchen.

Okay, I'm going to actually ignore all the hate emails and get right to the recipe for a change! Finally--something that requires a little effort! This is what a recipe is all about! It's the thrill of the bake! Happy baking everyone and good luck with everything you do~~

I modified & simplified: I used Pepperidge Farm pastry shells, brushing with egg & sprinkling with sugar before baking according to pkg directions. I substituted 11 (eak) oranges with only 1, sectioned & served on the side. Dissed the salt, replacing with 3/8 tsp McCormack orange peel. Nuts were chopped using a Mezzaluna. Served with Mondavi Muscato D'Oro = heaven!

This is a typical 'designer' foodie recipe: it looks OK but tastes lousy; puff pastry is rarely acceptable cold but the filling is a good idea, improved with a little Grand Marnier. The pistachios should also be crushed, not sprinkled whole. Better to use sweet short crust (pate sucree) pastry. It looks even better then!

How much orange juice in the cream cheese . This recipe is not well written and therefore difficult to evaluate.
