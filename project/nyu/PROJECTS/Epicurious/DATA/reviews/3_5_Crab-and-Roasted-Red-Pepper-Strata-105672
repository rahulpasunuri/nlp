This is a fantastic recipe. A few tweaks that I think put it over the top: added 1/2 cup of gruyere cheese, a dash of old bay, a spoonful of dijon mustard and left out the garlic. And one note: I imagine you'll be doing yourself a huge favor if you use jumbo lump versus claw meat or some other part of the crab -- it was so nice to have those great big chunks of crab in there. Anyway... heavenly. And it's nowhere near as labor-intensive as some reviewers have suggested. It's an easy make-ahead dish with very few steps.

This is so labor-intensige, takes a long time to make, and isn't even that good.

I agree with one of the other cooks - this is likely a four fork recipe only with some modification. I also added some Old Bay seasoning and layers of shredded gruyere cheese. The cheese was an essential part of the flavor. Easy to do as a 1/2 recipe. Wonderful centerpiece to our Christmas brunch!

This was a great Christmas brunch recipe. Took the advice of most and added Old Bay seasoning for some added flavor and used 1/2 half and half and 1/2 whole milk.

This was actually a 4-fork recipe, but I think if you had made it exactly as the recipe states it would only be a 3-fork recipe. I made some additions because I worried about the lack of cheese and potential lack of flavour: I actually beat 1/2 package of softened cream cheese into 7 extra large eggs before adding 3 cups of half & half and 1 cup of whipping cream (fat, I know, but I needed to use it up), then I stirred in 1 cup of shredded gruyere cheese and 1/2 cup of parmesan, and upped the fresh thyme to 1 tbsp. I also used French bread with crusts (For any Vancouverites, I used Terra Breads' French loaf and just sliced off the tough bottom crust before dicing it up). I also used 3 cans of real crabmeat, and the flavour was exceptional. I highly recommend upping the cream and adding an egg--it would have been way too dry without, as even like this it wasn't overly custardy.

I love a a good strata, especially for holidays or entertaining, but don't think this is a great one. Love the crab, but don't think the seasoning is right, tastes too unremarkable, given the ingredients. May try adding seafood seasoning like Old Bay or more herbs before giving up on it. Folks, if fresh crab is TOO expensive, use canned (near canned tuna), huge improvement over imiation!

Just shy of a 4 fork. I think that when I make it again a few minor changes will make it a 4 fork recipe. Used 3/4 pound of snow crab and 1/2 pound of imitation. Probably will cut the imitation down as it seems to have a bit stronger flavor. Also used prebought bread cubes and bottled roasted peppers and didn't notice one bit of decrease in quality. DEFINITELY make this the day before. Popped it together in about 1/2 hour on Christmas Eve afternoon, threw it in the oven at 9:30 Christmas morning and *huge* hit with the family. Next time I plan to layer it with bread on bottom, veggies, crab, cheese, repeat. Used a 13x9 pan and the baking time was the same. Also thought there was too much egg & 1/2 & 1/2 mix but after it sat overnight it was all soaked in. Really good dish!

Oh yeah, I forgot.....WAAAAAAAAAYYYYY too much egg for the half and half....add another 1/2 cup half and half. Ciao ciao :)

Strata's are amazingly simple animals. Try making a veggie and cheese strata or two before tackling this recipe. You will then get the hang of it, maybe. In Italy they make strata with a bread having the density of pound cake, but I just use plain old crappy white bread and it works every time, but then I know strata:) Oh yeah, put a good stinky swiss cheese in the recipe somewhere for veggie strata. This crab strata recipe seems to be suffering from a severe lack of cheese. Add and mix well a packet of instant onion soup mix and 8 oz. of cream cheese to the custard and then see if this puppy don't FLY!! Put a little mozzerella in a layer or two. Definately put this together the day before, strata loves to soak in it's own juices for a day and then be popped into the hot oven.

This is a super brunch recipe as you can prepare it the night before to enable you to spend more time with your guests. I made it twice now, following the recipe word for word and everyone loved it. Tastes great the second day too.

Usually I am in agreement with my fellow "epicureans", but on this one we are highly divergent. I agree with my husband who said this tasted like "cafeteria" food. (I did use the suggestions from other reviewers). Don't waste your time on this recipe.

I was disappointed. The crab overwhelmed the other flavors in this dish. Some of the crab substitutions mentioned in other reviews seem like good ideas; if I tried it again, it would be using some of those suggestions.

This is a fabulous recipe! I have also altered it when unable to find crab by replacing it with a 14 oz can of artichoke hearts and a tablespoon of capers. YUM!

Truly scrumptious brunch fare! I tripled this and offered it at a wedding brunch for 30 people and at least half of them have begged for the recipe or for me to make it again! Even my "eat nothing" daughter had 2 helpings and wanted to take home leftovers! It's not particularly spicy, but it is savory. Fluffy egg texture with the sweetness of the roasted red peppers to flavor it. A delicate dish, good for elegant affairs.

This was easy to make and tasted so good! I even used Egg Beaters and fat-free half-n-half and this dish was still rich. I followed others' suggestions and added some parmesan cheese to the egg mixture and used some extra on top. The next time I make this, I may add some additional seasoning. I did not want to overpower the flavor of the crab, however it could have used a little more kick.

My guests liked this a lot more than I did. I agree with the reviewer from Texas that this is pretty bland.

This dish was definitely more effort to make than most of the egg dishes I make, but so much yummier that it was well worth the extra work. It is very impressive. I made it into 10 pieces because I had 10 people, and the pieces were still satisfying. I loved it, and so did my guests!

We served this for brunch and it was a huge success. Even small eater were going back for seconds. Taking advise from another reviewer, I added some cheese to basic recipe, as well as for the topping. We let it sit overnight before baking, and the texure was perfect. We've received numerous requests for the recipe!

This is good, but I think the flavor could be'kicked up a notch.'

I made this for my grandmother on Mother's Day with smoked salmon. The magazine also had a wonderful Pork, Maple and Sage sausage patty recipe that went wonderfully with the strata. My Grandmother said it was a meal she would always remember.

This is a good recipe. I made it with imitation crab, and it was delicious. I happened to have a large amount of the stuff left after a certain recipe, and wandered into a great sale on red peppers. So using the search tools on this site I came to this spot. What a find, it worked. I used too much of my homemade roasted red peppers and would stay true to the recipe next time. But the imitation crab worked very well. It isn't just for "sushi", it works well with other recipes such as this. I would only complain that I would have liked more cheese, and will consider combining it into the strata, as well as topping.

This is a very elegant brunch dish, however cost of crab may prohibit me from making it again. Does anyone think bay scallops would work in this? Any other suggestions for substitutions?

Rating: 3
This was an excellent brunch dish. My only suggestion would be to cut way down on the thyme or eliminate it all together. It really overpowered the taste of the crab. At $27 a pound, you don't want to do that! Also, there was so much bread, I baked it in a lasagne pan, and I fretted there wasn't enough liquid, so I doubled the egg and half-and-half portions. My guests loved it and I would make it again, with those adjustments.

This was great and easy to prepare. My neighbor is a seafood rep., so I get my crab free. I used a pound and a half of crab. I added one more egg and some cream. My guests loved it. I"ll make this for Easter brunch.

I used Egg Beaters and Fat Free half and half, and it was still delicious! I made it in individual souffle dishes for presentation, and we had a couple leftover that we re-heated for dinner the next day and served with a lightly dressed Mesclun salad. YUM! I'll be making this for my family on Easter.

This has become a favorite company brunch recipe. I've also made it with fresh salmon (which I broiled briefly to make it easy to flake) instead of crab for guests who were allergic to shellfish. We think it's even better with salmon.

I made this dish on Christmas morning, and it was wonderful. Actually, I made it the day before, and baked it on Christmas morning. I used canned crab instead of fresh, and I got rave reviews all around.

This was a really good brunch dish that my husband and I really liked. I made mine in an 8-inch souffle dish, so it would be more decorative at the table, and though it did take longer to bake it was delicious.

We made this along with the pork, maple and sage patties and the corn salad with cherry tomatoes and oven-roasted green onions (all from the Oct. 2001 Bon Appetit) for a brunch and all of it was wonderful. I don't even like eggs, but I thought the 1lb of crabmeant would cover up the eggy taste and I was right. So delicious! Also, we made everything the day before - so easy!
