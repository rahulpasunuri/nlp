We LOVE this cookie recipe. It was a huge hit with my family. My husband took a tin to a gathering of his guy friends and they couldn't stop eating them. It's a great base recipe for other chocolate chip type cookies. We used mint chocolate chips once and they were heavenly. Will try white chocolate macadamia nut too. This is a perfect cookie!

Consistency excellent but go easier on the salt!

Of course these are good! 1 1/2 sticks of butter. I loved them!

These are my husbands favorite chocolate chip cookies I have made so far. They are thin, chewy, and crispy around the edges. If you like this style, these cookies are perfect.

These are my husband's favorite chocolate chip cookies I have made yet. They are very thin, chewy, and have crispy edges. If you like your cookies this way, this is the perfect recipe.

Cookie texture is such a personal preference, but these really missed the mark for me.

The beauty of these cookies is in their simplicity. Straight up buttery, crunchy with soft centers. this is an excellent plain chocolate chip cookie recipe, no need for additives.

My chocolate chip cookies are always awful. This is the first time that I've ever made chocolate chip cookies and they came out like they were supposed too. And they were delicious! This has become my official go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe.

This is great chocolate chip cookie recipe if, like the description states, you like your chocolate chip cookies crunchy on the edges and soft in the center. I got 20 cookies out of the recipe and they were pretty big, the next time I make these cookies I would make them half the size. All around a good recipe, the edges go quick though!

Just like the note says, the edges are crunchy and the center is soft. Very good recipe. Yum!
