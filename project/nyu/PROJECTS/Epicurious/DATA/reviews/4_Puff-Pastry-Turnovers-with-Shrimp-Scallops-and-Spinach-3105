This excellent and easy, but it should be noted that rolling out the pastry is essential as is sealing everything inside. Also, it might be worth limiting the amount of cream sauce you put inside as this is the most likely thing to leak and soak the pastry.

These make great appetizers, but without the seafood! They are too crowded and lumpy with it. Give it a try our way, you won't be sorry!

Made these for a retirement dinner as an appetizer. Delicious but very, very rich. I used phyllo dough instead of puff pastry. I agree with the reviewer who suggested being judicious with the mustard - I used a mild one and I'm glad I did, otherwise the flavor would have taken over.

This had such promise, and the mustard ruined it. Be very judicious with the mustard unless you're a huge fan.

I made these pastries many times and have had people love them every time. The sauce takes me much longer than the 12 minutes stated to reduce, closer to 25 but I use a gentle boil. I've also used light cream to reduce fat and baby scallops to reduce the cost and have actually liked it better this way. I once also bought phyllo by mistake and it still tasted great.

This was fantastic. It needs light foods to accompany it because it's very decadent and rich. Somehow I ended up with alot of extra seafood. Great for vegetarians - Just use veggie broth and leave out the seafood. Freezes so you can whip up a fancy entree or appetizer in no time, however, the spinach filling becomes dark colored so even though it tastes great it's not as appetizing looking as the first time around.

Excellent! Made in appetizer portions, soutwestern style: No Dijon, but added a little less than 1/4 c. chopped, fresh New Mexico green chile instead (Que Bueno is a good substitute). No scallops to be found, so I used crab instead- Perfect!

Great recipe, the Dijon adds a nice flavor. Used baby scallops instead with excellent results.

This was great! I used dried shiitake which gave this recipe a ton of great flavor.

i rarely review recipes but i had to come online for this one... absolutely delicious. my sister wasn't so impressed when she READ the recipe but she immediately changed her mind when she TASTED this. i did modify according to suggestions of some- smaller portion (which worked out well) formed into triangles (prettier presentation) eggwash (i made 2 batches, one with eggwash and one without and the withOUT formed a browner, better crust) i will try to use pastry tart shells, as one person recommended. to make in advance and for smaller appetizer portions. I LOVED THIS AND WOULD DEF. MAKE AGAIN

The filling took me close to an hour to thicken to right consistency. I used bay scallops and ommitted shrimp to save a bit. They turned out great and were the hit of the party.

Made the filling in the morning. Kept it in the fridge - you could even made it the day before because we had leftovers and it was fine. Instead of making a turnover, I bought puff pastry shells, cooked them 2 hours before and then filled them with the heated filling and put them in the oven for 5 minutes to heat everything together. Delicious!Everybody loved it, I had made an extra one and my friend's 14 year old son had seconds before the main course.

Amazing. Used medium shrimp, which I cut in smaller pieces, and bay scallops. I halved the recipe to make 4 portions. I used slightly less Dijon, fresh spinach (which I boiled, chopped and drained) but otherwise followed the recipe. I imagine that this would be fantastic as a sauce over veal or chicken (before it's too reduced). I will make again next week in smaller bite-size appetizers.

This dish is to die for!!!!!! I can't say enough about it. served it as a main dish.

This was a great first course! I used smaller pieces of shrimp and scallops as suggested. Next time, I would make the triangles smaller. They freeze well after they have been cooked. Just re-heat directly from the freezer.

This was great, i made it for a spanish project where i had to film myself making a dish in spanish and it was very easy to prepare and i got an A on the project!! Great recipe!!!!

Yummy!! Very easy to prepare and can make ahead. Used the smaller shrimp (41 count) and smaller scallops. Folded into triangles and scalloped the edges with my fingers.I served them at Thanksgiving as a first course (with champagne, of course). Have also served two per person as part of a main dish with roasted butternut soup. Always receives rave reviews.

Incredibly delicious and easy! This would be tasty without the scallops, also. Directions were a little tricky so I cut each sheet into 8 pieces to make a total of 16 individual puffs.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner, in case, one or some of my guest didn't care for turkey.. It was a total success!!!! We loved it so much, I'm making it again tonight for dinner w/ a salad! (I used bay scallops; they worked just fine and tonight, I'm using onion/garlic combo instead of shallots)

This recipe is outstanding - made it as an appetizer for New Year's Eve dinner. Used Fillo dough as I couldn't find puff pastry. 4 of us ate almost the entire thing!

This made an excellent appetizer that disappeared quickly at Thanksgiving. I did make a few alterations to the recipe. I made 32 triangle-shaped appetizers (required rolling the sheets out more than called for). I omitted the scallops but will try them next time (the small frozen scallops are fairly inexpensive at Trader Joe's). I reduced the mustard to 1 T. but still found the flavor overpowering. Finally, before baking, I brushed a beaten egg over the tops of the triangles. Although this recipe is time-consuming to prepare, it is well worth the effort for special occasions!

I made this recipe yesterday as one of the entrees for my daughter's Sweet Sixteen Luncheon. I too, omitted the scallops and put in more shrimp cut into bite size pieces. I made them a little smaller and in the shape of triangles. EVERYONE raved, even my mother-in-law, who claims I can't cook! These are a definite winner and will stay in my recipe box. Very easy and a great make ahead dish, then pop in the oven once your guests arrive.

This was a great appetizer and easy to make! I also cut the shrimp and scallops into smaller pieces, which worked out well. I also folded the pastry into triangles instead of rectangles (I think that it looked better that way). Next time I think that I will omit the scallops all together and just use more shrimp - the scallops were pretty bland and didn't stand out much. I will also use a little less mustard. Over all - very good!

It took a while to prepare, but it was excellent. Used a light egg wash on the dough which also helped seal the seams. Sprinkled the top with sunflower seeds for a little crunch. Froze well. Thanks!

I made these according to the recipe, except I used fresh spinach from Costco. I guessed at the amount (steamed, chopped, and squeezed out the liquid)and it turned out perfectly! I did, as others suggested, use smaller pieces of the shrimp and scallops...about 1/2 inch chunks of each. As written, these portions are very large, and the cream "sauce" is very rich. Next time, I would do small, triangular shaped appetizer pieces. It freezes well, too!

This was a big hit with the Board of our wine tasting group and they are all gourmets! My suggestion is to be sure to use parchment paper on the baking sheets, as they have a tendency to "leak" a bit. I would agree with an earlier cook who suggested smaller shrimp and smaller scallop pieces, especially for an appetizer portion. Bon appetit!

This recipe was delectable and truly complemented when served with champagne. I did not have puff pastry so I substituted it with filo dough. I also cut the shrimp and scallops into smaller pieces - my guests raved!

I made this for a dinner party this past weekend and it was a hit! Tasted unbelievable. However, putting the pastry together was a bit trying. I would definitly make this again but wrap the pastry different. The directions make it sound so easy but mine looked like poorly wrapped Christmas presents. Good thing they tasted so good....none where left!

This was excellent. My only suggestion is that, because this is a first course, the size of the turnovers and the amount of filling in each be decreased. I used medium shrimp instead of large, and I cut the scallops in half vertically after cutting them horizontally as the recipe calls for. I also cut smaller squares of pastry. All in all, a tasty treat!

Delicious. I served this as a first course for an elegant New Year's Eve Dinner on a bed of greens. My only problem was that the pastry did not cook evenly (more brown on the bottom than the top). That could have been my oven more than anything else. I also used small bay scallops rather than the large ones (only the bay scallops were available), which turned out great.

Tonight I used this recipe to complement a broccoli/cheese/corn chowder. It was leftover night, so I used leftover salmon instead of the shellfish and substituted an entire head of garlic and one-half an onion for the shallots.We had unexpected company and everyone gave our dinner the 4 star approval. THANKS!!

This recipe sounds excellent.. but if you look at the directions for the puff pastry, one would think that the 12 inch rolled out pastry is one piece. How can you get 8 servings with only two pieces of the pastry. It should tell you to cut the 12 inch square into four squares.

Quite easy and impressive. I had a little trouble keeping the triangles sealed, but that did not hurt the presentation. I would not recommend freezing and reheating prepared pastry, but you could certainly make the filling a day in advance.
