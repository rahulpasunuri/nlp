This was great! I'll try it with the onions and garlic the next time around. Our family used Gardenburgers, b/c we don't care for the Boca burgers that were mentioned by other reviewers. Also used vegenaise (available at health food stores) instead of mayo. : )

I varied this slightly to our tastes and dietary limits. Used Boca Burgers w/Onion and sauteed several sliced cloves of garlic with the eggplant. Substituted whole wheat pita bread for the focaccia. Very satisfying and tasty!

These are good if you like veggie burgers. We recommend Boca burgers. Amy's have too many mushrooms. Don't overcook the eggplant, or use too much salt. Otherwise this makes a tasty sandwich.
