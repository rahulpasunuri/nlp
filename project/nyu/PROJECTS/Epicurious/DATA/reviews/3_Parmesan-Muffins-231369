i had to register, just to express my gratitude for the hint with heating milk with rosemary - it was perfect. i can't imagine what they would have tasted like, had i thrown the rosemary directly in. i also pitched in some parsley stems into the milk, as i included parsley in the muffins. skipped the olive oil, regretfully! anybody try a parmesan crumble? and - mine came out rather pale-ish - what's all that about? to cheese up the muffin i would dare a percorino and will report back.

While this recipe seemed too strong as muffins at first try, the recipe seems to be good for more than simply muffins.Today I crumbled the muffins over bowls of chili with delicious results. I also plan to use the crumbled muffins as breading for chicken and/or pork chops.I will definitely make this recipe again. The next time I make the muffins, I will use a little less rosemary and cheese. I'm certain they will be delicious.

Thank you for the idea of half flower, half cornmeal substitute. I used gluten-free flour, maybe that was part of the downfall, too.

I will have to do this again 'cause so many people liked this recipe. I ended up with a perfumey and salty tasting muffin. It was completely inedible! I think I may have used too much fresh rosemary. I think we could cut way back on the parmesan too. I have another recipe where the rosemary is heated in the milk on the stovetop. After the milk comes to a simmer, the rosemary is removed, leaving behind only the taste of the rosemary, but not the fresh leaves. I liked that recipe much better. Will try again and report back. I am planning to pulverize the muffins I made and use them as breading on chicken or pork chops. Whew! Ick!

I incorporated some reviewers' suggestions to make this a 4 fork dish. Reducing the sugar to 1tbsp gives the muffins a faint sweetness that complements, instead of overpowering the other flavours. I replaced 1/2c of the flour with cornmeal for some texture, and added 1/4c diced roasted green chile for a southwestern flavour. I also made these in mini-muffin tins (12mins baking time) and they turned out incredibly.

I read all of the reviews and was extremely skeptical about making this recipe, but I did it anyway and boy am I glad that I did. I also omitted all sugar, added 2 Tablespoons sour cream and some mozzarella cheese. I made them into mini-muffins and they were outstanding!! I hope this helps anyone sort out the mixed reviews.

Thank you for a wonderful, EASY recipe! I made them exactly as the recipe stated and they were absolutely perfect. They are a nice change from garlic bread with Italian dishes. I used freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. I will make them again and again.

I omitted all sugar, added a big dollop of creme fraiche to the olive oil, and made 24 mini muffins. Not bad.

Ok, so I used 1 teaspoon of sugar instead of two. I used slightly less olive oil than is called for. A touch more garlic and added shredded cheddar, asiago and mozzerella to the parmesan... It was a HUGE hit! They were flying off the table. It's a great idea but the original recipe just needed some work. Experiment a little with it, it's worth it.

I found the cheese and sugar flavors an odd combination - threw them away after everyone in the family tasted them. Would rather try a totally savory cheese muffin.

I made these last night, as mini-muffins, and served them to kids, and they loved them. The adults liked them too. forgot about the garlic, so I added garlic powder instead and it was lovely.

These were easy and tasty - even rewarmed in the microwave. Funky taste? They taste like Parmesan cheese with rosemary. Great for an alternative to bread with a tossed salad for lunch, or rewarmed as an afternoon snack.

I hate when people comment without testing the recipe, but since Epicurious did not print the Linzer muffin refipe, I have to recommend it myself. I've made it three times in the past two days just to keep up with demand. And yes, the choc-cherry muffins are revolting. Chalky and entirely lacking in flavor.

I just made these, and just ate two, and while I like them more than I hate them, I can understand the mixed reviews. They're kind of . . . funky. I think the problem is that they're a little too sweet, which makes the garlic and rosemary flavors seem incongruous. I'd push them further along in the savory direction, cutting the sugar by 3/4, upping the salt, and adding a bit of cornmeal. Note that when I pulverized 2 oz. Parmesan in my food processor, I got 1/2 cup, not 1 cup. So I added a bit more, for about 3/4 cup total. So part of the problem may also be that they goofed on the amount of cheese. More cheese=more salty. But there's still a shocking amount of sugar in these. I'm sure that's why a few reviewers' kids like them.

Excellent--my horribly picky youngest son ate several!

Looks to me like this recipe rates a 50% approval rate, one cook loved it, the other threw it out.

Excellent muffins! My 6 year old loves them. I didn't have enough parm so I substituted Romano. I really liked the extra bite that it added.

Strange flavor. Threw them out. I would much rather make cheddar chives scones.

this is a great muffin - used self-rising flour. also made with sharp cheddar cheese and italian seasoning.
