I give this 4 forks because not only is it very flavorful it is also SO EASY. I usually avoid stir fries because of all the chopping but here it's only carrots and zucchini and cucumber. I didn't have lemongrass or peanuts, but it was still great. I used half the amount of sugar called for in the vinegar mixture (it turns out to be a syrup). I think following the times for the veggies was key for me - they turned out perfect. It is going in our regular rotation.

Wonderful stir fry to use most of this weeks csa share. I added in some long beans and bok choy and followed the recipe to a T. Love love love the chili oil.

I don't change up stuff often but I was in a pinch and had to do the following: no chili so I omitted; no lemongrass so I zested a lime; the cucumber didn't appeal so I omitted that too; didn't have coriander (live in a small town without resources) so used lemon balm; no peanuts also omitted....OK enough said. This was really really good. I would have loved to make it as printed but what do you do? I added extra rice vinegar, extra garlic and just a pinch of brown sugar. I had cold rice in the fridge and I put that in at the end instead of putting the stuff over. My kids LOVED it and I have two who are not too fussy about shellfish. I recommend the lime wedges (if you like them) as it lends such an acidic bite. ummmm what a great stirfry. Into the rotation you go.

I'd say the stir fry was pretty good. I cut the sugar in half but used all the rice vinegar. I omitted the chili but added chili oil to mine after the fact. Without the chili oil it wouldn't have tasted like much to me. I liked having cucumber in the stir fry, that was neat.

This gets a resounding "enh" from me. I agree that it was too sweet even with the sugar cut down--I'd say half it at the most. Best I can say is that it used many of the vegetables in this week's CSA share, and was decent. I say skip it unless you're dying to use the main ingrediants.

I took previous reviews into account and was careful with the sugar but apart from that, followed the recipe as given. It was superb - lots of Thai flavour, and quick and easy to make. I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe has become one of my favorites. It is refreshing and delicious. I have probably served it to very happy guests a dozen time or so. I wouldn't change a thing about it.

I modified this based on what I did and didn't have in my pantry. The only vegetable I used that was from the recipe was the carrots - I added Mung bean sprouts. I didn't have a chili on hand so I use Sriracha chili sauce instead and added some fish sauce to that mixture. I served it over coconut jasmine rice which was delicious.

I liked it more than my hubby, who immediately said it was too sweet for his taste -- and I had cut down the sugar. I'll make it again, but next time I'll cut down the sugar even more.

warning, this dish is really sweet. Could easily cut the sugar. Added a few Tbs fish sauce to vinegar to make more authentic. Also recommend using cucumber as a garnish cold - hot cucumbers are not so appealing.

I didn't have peanuts so I used toasted pine nuts. I also did not have a cucumber so I made this without that ingredient. Results were delicious. I served this over a wild rice mix that blended perfectly with the dish.

We loved the chili vinegar sauce and found it even more enhanced with a little Thai sweet chili sauce.

this was a great dish! Made while visiting my son and saughter-in-law in their new house. The guys did the chopping and we did the cooking. We served pot stickers as an appetizer, chicken coconut soup and the stir fry with jasmine rice. will be having this often.

Makes a wonderful meal, my wife, who is an excellant cook, complimented me on what a great and unique dish it was. I did substitue the english cucumber for water chestnuts and it worked out amazing. Instead of serving it up on 'regular' rice, I used sweet rice. Also, I cut the sugar in half on the recomendation of others who have cooked this recipe. All-in-all, a great dish that leaves lots of room for creativity and that is quick to make.

I have made this dish several times and always get great reviews. The last time I made it I had an unexpected 5 guests for dinner and I was rather nervous as I felt unprepared. They loved it and I was a cooking goddess for having whipped it up so quickly!!!!

Very tasty. The ginger and lemongrass give the shrimp a great flavor. Everyone at dinner gobbled it up.

Good dish, but not really that Thai inspired. I would halve the sugar and add some fish sauce to the hot pepper sauce. Also, add some mushrooms and oninons to the vege mix. The shrimp mixture is tasty.. will use that in other recipe's.

I thought the recipe was great the way it was, without changes or additions. I like the zip of the sweet and sour sauce. I barely stir-fried the last set of ingredients (cucumber, peanuts, scallions, cilantro), until just warmed, for maximum crunch and fresh flavor. Great textures!

This is delicious.......I, like others, used less sugar than called for. I used about 1/8 cup which was plenty. Also, I didn't have the red pepper, so instead used about a teaspoon or so of crushed red peppers and that worked great. Be sure to sprinkle minced fresh mint over each dish....that absolutely made the dish!

Wow. I am not a shrimp lover but man .... absolutley scrumptuous. If you are thinking of trying it ... DO!!!!

I thought this was a great dish, perfect with a thai coconut milk & vegetable curry and rice. I fully agree with the other suggestions to reduce the amount of vinegar and sugar by about a third. I'd also suggest using fish sauce instead of salt, adding more garlic, and skipping the carrots and cucumber since they're more of an indonesian thing.

This a favorite with myself and partner and I have made it often over the last year. I checked the web page to print it off (I have been using from original in magazine) and I see a mistake in the recipe on the web. It should be 1/4 cup vinegar, not 1 1/4 cups. That would be overpowering!

After reading the reviews of this recipe, I cut the vinegar and sugar by half and it turned out to be perfect. It's a delicious and beautiful dish. I will make for company next time.

An overpowering combination of sugar and vinegar. I was looking forward to the subtle flavors of the other ingredients and was unable to locate them.
