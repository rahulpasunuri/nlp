Delicious! However, I suggest oven-roasting the squash (this adds a richer flavor and you can also bake the entire squash and double the recipe). I baked mine at 350 degrees F for approximately 45 min. I also added a clove of freshly minced garlic to the (doubled) recipe and plenty of salt & pepper. It is a wonderful side dish to any meat/sausage/fish!

I thought this was great, even with a few substitutions and a tweak or two. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried, and I don't care for a lot of oregano so I used herbs de provence instead. I used shaved parm and a diced medium tomato. After I scraped the squash, I drained it and squeezed it out with a paper towel - otherwise it would have been much too watery. We really loved this as a side-dish to roasted chicken.

I made this for the first time. I followed the recipe, except I added tilapia like someone suggested. It was delish although it did need more cheese. I felt like there was a flavor missing to this dish but couldn't put my finger on it. Will make again.

Speghetti Squash is amazing! My husband loved this. I also added cubes of fresh mozzerella. Make sure you seed the tomatoes before adding them to the squash, otherwise your dish will come our runny. I think it's even better the next day after all the flavors have set in.

Yummy and so easy. The only change we made was substituting Italian seasoning for oregano. Oh, and adding a bit more cheese, of course! Next time I think we'll try adding grilled shrimp as suggested by another reviewer. All in all I'd say this makes a great light and fresh-tasting meal or would be great as a side with many things.

Made this with sauteed tilapia and the combination of the two was excellent.

Was a hit with my family. Added chicken and pesto, cooked the squash in the oven with water and used three quarters of it. Used grape tomatoes roughly cut. Nice parmesean cheese was an excellent topper. Served with a spinach salad.

Yum. I add more cheese and used canned tomatoes.

Forgot to add to my previous post that I also included roasted chicken to give the dish yummy protein. Delicious!

I have made this dish multiple times following the suggestions of roasting portabella mushrooms, red onions, and Roma tomatoes w/garlic, lots of good quality olive oil, fresh basil, and oregano, adding that to the squash w/toasted pine nuts and parmesan/asiago cheese mixture. It has been a continuous hit!

Tried adding more and more cheese to safe this dish gone wrong . . . hopeless. I recommend sticking to plain old spaghetti squash with salt and pepper.

I can't rate this either cuz I basically followed A Cook from Seattle's recipe and it came out FANTASTIC. Used green olives instead of artichokes. Yum! My husband loved it too. I will definitely be making spaghetti squash a lot more in the future.

Following the reviews of the cooks that came before me, I baked the spaghetti squash in the oven at 375 for 40 minutes. I sauteed onion, sliced baby bella mushroom, and garlic in olive oil with the oregano and then added the basil and 1/2 lb of shrimp. I topped it with a shredded 3 cheese blend. This was my first experience with spaghetti squash, and I was very pleasantly surprised. I look forward to making this dish again.

I didn't give this a fork rating as i changed so much of the recipe after reading the reviews. But I sauteed 2 cloves garlic in olive oil with one 1 tsp italian herbs and then added a can of drained tomatoes. Then I added 1/4 cup sun-dried tomatoes, a 1/2 cup black olives and a small jar of artichokes. I let it simmer for a bit and then poured all over the strings of spaghetti squash that i'd already baked in the oven for about 3/4 hour. (I had nestled the stringy squash into a lasagna pan.) I topped it with 1/2 cup grated fresh parmesean cheese and chopped fresh basil, then baked for about 20 minutes. Really great. My husband loved it and now prefers it to regular spaghetti. Also, I baked the squash teh night before and took out the insides, then stored in the refrigerator.

I baked the squash upside down in 1/2 inch of water for 40 minutes at 350. I used pesto, olive oil, tomatoes, salt and papper and sauteed it all for a few minutes, then topped it with some fresh parmesan. Awesome!

Following everyone's advice, I adapted the recipe as follows: Roasted the squash in the oven, at 375 for 45 minutes. Roasted, for the same time/temp 3 roma tomatoes, 2 orange tomatoes, 3 salad tomatoes, some fresh garlic, chopped sweet onion, basil, dried oregano, tons of olive oil, cracked pepper and sea salt. Garnished with fresh grated Parmesan-Reggiano. Unbelievable.

Taking all of the prior reviewers' advice, I made the following changes with FABULOUS results: I roasted about 8 roma tomatoes, quartered, in plenty of good olive oil, with whole garlic cloves and fresh oregano-for about 2 hrs in a low oven. I added the tomatoes and their oil, to the cooked spaghetti squash. I then added the fresh basil, some toasted pine nuts and good parmesan. I then took it a step further and added some cooked chicken breast, which made for a very hearty fall meal. The tomatoes take a while, but they're pretty hands-off...well worth the time, if you have it.

Wonderful! This was the first time we'd ever tried spaghetti squash, and my husband and I both loved it. The squash itself is not particularly flavorful, but this preparation is great. I baked the squash instead of microwaving and substituted Asiago cheese for the parmesan. We'll definitely make this one again.

EXCELLENT week-night dinner; this only took me 15 min. to prepare, and it was really tasty!

Faced with a totally unfamiliar spaghetti squash and not a single recipe, I turned to save-the-day Epicurious and there it was. Many reviewers thought it was too bland, so I dug through my overflowing condiment shelf and came up with sun-dried tomatoes (I had no fresh ones on hand and I don't live in the city) and a jar of artichoke/caper spread. While the squash was steaming I minced only one garlic clove for this smaller-than-recipe squash and added it to the olive oil, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, artichoke spread, oregano and basil, with fresh-ground salt and pepper. Goo-oo-ood, oh my! I completely forgot the parmesan, which would have been perfect. My only advice is to use fresh herbs for sure-- the dried ones I had on hand were pretty blah, and the dish would sing with bright fresh basil and oregano. My squash was about 1-1/2 pounds, and 8 minutes in the MW was almost overdone. Definitely one to repeat!

This recipe was very easy to make and tasted delicious! I used the whole spaghetti squash and just doubled the recipe.

This was delicious. I had never tasted spaghetti squash, never cooked it either, and this was easy. I doubled the recipe, cooked both halves in the microwave for about 20 - 22 minutes; just enough time. This was a really delicious dish, but I think it needs quite a bit of salt to balance the sweetness of the basil. I also used 1T fresh oregano instead of dried, and it was great. Good combo of flavors, and kids would probably like it, too.

Very easy and tasty. Will certainly make again -- would probably spice it up a bit next time, though.

Thank you, Ontario, for your voice of reason. I thought "why not use the whole squash and double the other ingredients?" It's a good recipe but the logic of epicurious is often curious indeed. Make sure you use spaghetti squash (if you are a squash novice) because it really does make a difference in this dish and other squashes can overcook too easily.

Simple and delicious. I've added a clove of minced shallots to this recipe and turned out wonderful. I had no idea how good spaghetti squash is. I would definetely make it again.

I can't understand why the recipe calls for a 3 lb squash, and then tells us to reserve other half for another use!!! Why not use a 1.5 pound smaller squash and adjust the other ingredients accordingly.

OK 18 min was much too long for cooking both halves. Flavor was good but needed something more - maybe some crushed red pepper etc.

I cut the squash in half with cut sides down and baked on greased pan with a little waters at 350 for 30 min. The squash can be scraped out very easily and it's no trouble to mix with the other ingredients. I didn't have fresh basil so I used 1/4 c. pesto sauce and reduced the olive oil to 1 T. It was very tasty. It serves more than 2, however.

A pretty simple recipe, definitely not rocket science in the culinary world. However, I did enjoy it for two lunches - once stuffed in a pita, and the next day by itself (as per the recipe). It was light and flavourful. I get the impression that some of the other reviewers may not have used spaghetti squash, since it's virtually impossible to overcook, and doesn't really have a 'squashy taste'.

We thought the squash was very flavorful. Much better than plain ole squash. I cooked it in the oven...put it all together in a shallow casserole topped it with the parmesean cheese and kept in a warm oven while finishing the rest of the meal. The seasonings may have melded better. It was attractive and colorful too.

I overcooked the squash the first time and again the second time even though I nuked it for 9 minutes. The taste left a lot to be desired, even as an accompanying dish.

We used this dish as a delicious pizza topping with shredded mozzarella cheese on top. Really yummy.

I have to admit, it's really healthy and extremely easy to make. I'd recommend you use REALLY good quality olive oil, though, or that squash-y taste is a little too strong. That is, unless you like that squashy taste.

Quite yummy and very easy. Depending on the size of the squash, it may not feed 2 people fully. I'd pick a large squash to ensure 2 good portions.
