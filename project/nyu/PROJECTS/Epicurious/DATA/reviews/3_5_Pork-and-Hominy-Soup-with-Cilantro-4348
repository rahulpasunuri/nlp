Okay but I added the juice of three limes for fresh taste. Did not have posole so I used black beans. It was still yummy

The whole family enjoyed this soup. Husband said he would eat it any day. When I had this soup in Old Town San Diego, the oregano, red pepper flakes, finely chopped onion and cilantro were on the side, to add to the soup to taste. When I made it, I cooked the pepper flakes and oregano with the soup, and left out the onion and cilantro, which, to us, gave a fresher taste of the vegetables.

My husband and I love this soup! The flavors are wonderful and they are even better the next day. My next batch will be a double to freeze for a later date.

This recipe turned out beautifully! I followed some of the suggestions here and added a few dried new mexican chiles to the soup, and offered radishes and cabbage as garnishes. I also served lime wedges alongside... 1/4 lime squeezed into a bowl serving really brought out the flavors.

i agree that it was a great base. I strengenthed the stock with pork and chicken bones (boneless pork not available, and chicken bones just happened to be available from another dish), and handfuls of dried peppers on hand...ancho, pasillo, etc. Let sit overnight to skim fat. More onion and garlic, added a habanero, and i like lots of hominy. garnished with queso seca, thin sliced cabbage, whole dried oregano, radishes and sliced jalapenos as well as cilantro. dad approved, and that's no mean feat.

This was a GREAT base for Posole. My hispanic co-worker and I made this last night, and the results were fantastic. The only major changes made to this recipe was to add an onion, extra garlic, a few dried peppers (guajillo, ancho, etc would all be fine), and oregano to the initial preparation. Also, we only used one can of Hominy. When the pork gets tender, serve this up with sliced cabbage (we used napa), radishes, onion, and jalepeños. Would definately recommend this recipe to anyone who likes Posole, or anyone who has never had the pleasure to try posole.
