This was delicious and so easy!! A big hit at our NYE party. The real crab meat really shone. I flipped the toasts over 1/2 through cooking so they were toasted on both sides, that seemed to help keep them from getting soggy once the crab was placed on top. Can't wait to make again. YUM!

Have made this many times - love it. However, do not make the toasts one day in advance. I did, once only. Kept them in a zip-lock bag and they were soft/soggy the next day. Toasts made same day are great. Have also served the crab on melba rounds.

This was so easy, but I didn't chill it long enough. I didn't have time to make my own toast so I also used the store bought and they were fine. I just added cayenne to the crab mixture.

I served this with store bought mini-toasts and placed all of the crab mixture in the center of a plate with the toasts around it, for people to make their own canapes. It is delicious, and has lots of crab flavor.

These were very good. I used fresh jumbo lump as the recipe called for and it stood up well to the mayo and sour cream. Instead of the cayenne I used a spicy, smoked paprika. That added a nice kick to the mixture.

For a very easy but tasty appetizer this is a winner. Used canned crab meat but fresh dill. Added just a touch of tarragon and doubled the amount of cayenne on the toast points. Garnished with fresh dill and lemon. Good taste for the ease of preparation.

Since the first time I served this, the requests have not stopped! It is now required at every holiday meal plus special requests for friends!! I use pepperidge farm white bread (it is firm and sliced thinner than avg. bread) perfect for this recipe. Can't say enough good things about this recipe. In a pinch, I eliminate the toasts and serve with crackers. This one is a hit and easy to prepare!!! Buy good crabmeat, it's worth it.

The crab needed "something" so I added some freshly ground black pepper as well as garlic powder and Old Bay Seasoning. Letting the mixture sit in the refrigerator for a bit to blend the flavors is a good idea.

Toasts were made 1 day ahead and kept airtight as directed; upon use they were soft and uninteresting. The crab topping was quite ordinary and dominated by shallot rather than crab flavor.

This is simple and easy. I was in a pinch and used the fake crab(sorry). This recipe was simple,and delicious. My guests asolutely loved it.

This was a simple, elegant, delicious hors d'oeuvres that I plan to make again. I used backfin crab meat--lump was just too expensive and not warranted, in my opinion. Also, for those who felt this was bland, I'll be they didn't use enough salt, which was necessary to bring out the flavors.

Loved the toast!!! The dip was bland. I replaced the dip with a smoked salmon dip. Served numerous times with great reviews.

i didn't have any crab and i am not about to use the fake stuff, so i replaced the crab with salmon and it was to die for. i marinated the salmon with lime, lemon, and salt and left it in the fridge for about an hour. i would make this again and again and again ....

Served these as an appetizer for Christmas Eve dinner and they were snatched up. They were simple to prepare and tasty. I whipped up a second batch of just the crab dip with the leftover ingredients the next day and served with crackers, which was also good.

I jazzed this stuff up as much as possible without creating a completely different recipe and it still was so-so. I used dungeness crab fresh off the boat, added some chopped chives, doubled the cayenne, and dusted with paprika for color. The guests at the party did like it but I was not wowed by it at all. The crab was lost in the mayo and sour cream. Disappointing.

I doubled the Cayenne, as per reviewers' suggestions, but will probably kick that up even more next time. For as easy as it was to prepare, it was a hit at the party I made it for.

Lots of compliments from this one. I took the advice of others and doubled the cayenne and it definitely added the right finish to these! I used some small cutters to make some shapes other than squares for some variety too. Really easy, big hit.

I made this with back fin lump crabmeat. It was wonderful! The fresh dill on top was a great added touch. I used a dense bread similar in taste to the Peppridge Farm sandwich bread. I will try the frozen tartlets next. Will definitely make again!

Have now made this about 4 or 5 times and it is always a big hit. Definitely double the cayenne and use nice fresh dill. In a pinch I have used RealLemon and inexpensive crab and it is still good. The crab salad isn't anything special but what's wrong with good basic crab salad?

The Toasts are great, I use these and variations of these for many Appetizers (pate, roasted garlic, goat cheese, etc) but the crab salad is nothing special. I do add extra cayanne when making this variation.

what a waste of good crab meat - YUCKY!

Easy as pie and the favorite of all at my cocktail party. I used frozen tartlets instead of toasts. Still brushed them with the butter, (doubled the cayenne), crisped up the tarts in the oven then stuffed them. Sin of all sins I used the fake crabmeat, nobody seemed to mind as they devoured them.

Nothing special. Tasted just like the crab salad that appears at every picnic.

I have made this recipe countless times and every time it was a big hit. I have used imitation crab with success. It's easier, less expensive and faster than real crab. Great to make for a last minute contribution to a party!

Perfect hor d'oeuvre for any occasion. I use the canned 16 oz. crab from Costco (Phillips pasteurized crab meat) and triple the recipe as there never seems enough! The Costco crab is cheaper, easier and tastes fine in this dish.

A great, relatively easy appetizer for a party that everyone seemed to love! The crab and dill work well together, and they all disappeared before we got to them!

I agree, not enought cayenne, I doubled it. Used strained yogurt instead of sour cream, added a little more, also increased the lemon a little. Added a TINY BIT of tarragon, as dill and tarragon are magic together, but be careful...use only a very tiny amount. Will definitely make again. If you are in a hurry you can just spread softened butter on the bread,sprinkle cayenne and then bake. Not much difference in final product(I have done it both ways)and saves a step.

Excellent. I used Alaska King Crab, and (star,. round, etc.) cookie cutters to make the cayenne toasts more interesting. Disappears fast at every gathering.

Very yummy and easy -- made the toasts a day ahead. I used canned jumbo crab (surprisingly good) and doubled the cayenne as recommended. I sprinkled with Old Bay at the end to kick it up a notch.

Delicious and easy! I used Bumble Bee canned crab meat and it was wonderful. I agree with everyone on doubling the cayenne pepper. I will definitely make them again.

I used Pepperidge Farms extra thin white bread for the toasts. Definitely double the cayenne pepper. I used fresh dill in the crab salad, but it wasn't very nice looking dill so instead of garnishing with the dill, I added cappers. Outstanding

This appetizer was a big hit at a recent dinner party for 30. The recipe doubles easily. I did follow some of the review comments and doubled the amount of cayenne pepper - really added a good kick to it!. I made the toasts the day before, but they did not stay crispy. I had to pop them back in the oven before topping them with the crab.

Out of the three delicious types of canapes I made for dinner, this one was the hands-down favorite. Careful, though, they have wings--they really DO fly off the plate.

Very good. I should have listened to everyone else about the cayenne though! I served crab on cucumber slices as well as the cayenne toasts which was good for some variety.

This is an incredibly simple appetizer and is so delicious! It flew off the plate at my last dinner party. I, too, would add more cayenne, but liked the light flavor of the mayonnaise and other ingredients, which didn't interfere with the flavor of the crab.

This was easy to make but I found the flavor to be on the bland side. Also, I would add more cayenne and maybe a little more mayo or sour cream to make it stick together better.

A very easy, elegant appetizer. I would use a little more cayenne, though.
