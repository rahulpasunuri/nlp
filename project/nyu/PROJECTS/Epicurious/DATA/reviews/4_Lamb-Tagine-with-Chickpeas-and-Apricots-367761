Quite good. I made a 1/3 batch, and the result was yummy, though there wasn't much in the way of juices left after 1.5 hours--might have been because of the higher surface area to volume ratio for the small batch.

Absolutely delicious! I increased the garlic and the spices - 1/2 tsp. each of turmeric, ginger, and cumin. Also used canned chick peas - drain, rinse, place in small pan and cover with water. Add 2 cloves garlic and cinnamon stick. Bring to simmer then turn off, cover and let sit at least four hours or overnight. Drain and add to recipe. Also simmered covered one hour then uncovered 30 min as suggested - this works out fine. Serve with harissa and Mark Bitman's quick preserved lemons.

Delicious recipe! I tried it with 4 lbs. of chicken legs and thighs. For more veggies, I added sweet potato, summer squash, yellow bell pepper, and zucchini. I also added half of a cup of dried cherries after another reviewer's advice. So good! Just the right amount of spice and sweetness.

This is an excellent recipe. I agree with one reviewer that it is best to cook the tagine covered for 1 hour and uncovered for the last 30 minutes. Also, I didn't see the point in cooking the chick peas separately.I soaked them overnight, browned the lamb, and then added the cinnamon stick when I sauteed the onions. Rather than the 5 cloves of garlic, I chopped four to saute with the ginger and spices. I cooked the chick peas along with the rest of the ingredients and the whole thing came out wonderfully.

Excellent easy recipe that can be made in advance. Flavors get better when made ahead and reheated. Great for a dinner party as you don't have to be in the kitchen all of the time. Served with couscous and an Indian tomato-cucumber raita.

Wow! made this for dinner tonight with huge trepidation because i just don't love or even like lamb (to me it always tastes like beef gone wrong)but my boyfriend adores it. Well it was truly yummy. all the amazing spices coalesced into this fabulous stew that I couldn't stop eating, my mouth kept begging for more. and aside from cubing the lamb it couldn't have been easier. Highly recommended!!!

Hmm. Great flavors, but not sure about simmering with the lid off the entire cooking time. Lost a TON of liquid, and the lamb didn't have anything to braise in -- not exactly fork tender. I would strongly suggest cooking with the lid on for an hour and take it off the last 30 mins.

I found this recipe under the CHICKEN search, but the idea here is so right that it works great with chicken. Here's how adapted it (out of necessity): - chicken thighs and legs - adapted Ras el Hanout (I love moroccan food so I had all but the ground ginger on hand) - dried cherries - quinoa instead of couscous - water instead of stock The quinoa helped to balance the heavy, oily-ish sauce. Also followed another reviewer's suggestion to use canned chickpeas, simmering in garlic and cinnamon which, I agree, is spectacular and could have eaten it as a main dish. It was great and will become a staple.

Superb! Great depth of flavors! Made it exactly as stated but used the tip from the reviewer below and started with canned chickpeas which I boiled for 2 minutes with garlic and cinnamon and then let steep for a day. I also braised the lamb at a low temperature for about 45 minutes longer than stated. Was a little worried that there would be too much liquid in the tagine the day I made it, but when I took it out of the refrigerator the next day to reheat, some of the excess liquid got absorbed. This is a fabulous recipe!

Rave reviews. Just made for a dinner party -- doubled the recipe, used dried chickpeas as recommended (didn't soak overnight; just boiled for 2 mins then soaked for an hour), crushed San Marzanos, and heaping teaspoons of Ras-el-Hanout from our local middle eastern store. Will definitely make again. I did cook it a bit longer so it boiled down, but once there, the consistency was perfect.

I love the spices in this dish. I tend to make it with white fish rather than lamb. I also generally add lots of veggies (whatever I have on hand, carrots, potatoes, green beans, peppers).

Made this again, this time with a mixture of shoulder chops and cubed shoulder (we bought a whole lamb and we have more chops than stew meat, and it's just so much work to cube everything). Don't know if the cubed meat made this difference, but this time the consistency was perfect. Upped the chickpeas to about 1 and 1/4 cup. This recipe is absolutely divine. I just made it and I'm still dreaming about it.

I've made many versions of this dish. I think this may be my favorite (my husbands too)! Very easy to make and extremly satisifying.

We enjoyed this very much and my husband ate three servings. I followed the recipe exactly but used shoulder chops instead of cubes because I thought the bone would add some additional flavor (and I didn't feel like cubing it). The recipe turned out more watery than the photo and I wondered if this was because I used the chops. Will try cubes as set forth in the recipe next time. My personal favorite was the chickpeas, which had fabulous flavor after being simmered with the garlic. I wished there were more in the recipe and next time will increase the amount. The dried apricots were divine. Overall, will be making this again and soon.

Delicious! Followed recipe. Will definitely make again.

This is absolutely delicious and simple! I used lamb leg meat instead of lamb shoulder which is leaner and took a shortcut using canned chickpeas.

A solid lamb tagine. The spice mix was well-balanced, a bit of a spicy kick form the red pepper, but the dish still had that sweetness from the apricots and onions, without being cloying. Will make again.
