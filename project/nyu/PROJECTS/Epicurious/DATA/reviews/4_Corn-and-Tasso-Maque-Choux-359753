Ridiculous! Outstanding. This is so amazing. I brought this to a barbecue last year, and served it as a cold side dish, and it was the first thing to disappear. Actually, there was some left over and I ate the rest of it out of the bowl with a plastic spoon on my drive home. You could make this vegetarian, as the other two posters suggested, but if you can find tasso ham definitely use it, it adds a smoky heat to the flavor profile that you don't get with Black Forest or even Virgina ham.

This goes amazingly well with steak. The ham is not really necessary.

Delicious, colorful, easy to make! Takes a little prep work but when everything is diced ahead you can put it together while the steaks cook. Made it twice using Walmart deli Black Forest ham the first time. Don't bother with the ham - it adds nothing and the dish is very good anyway. Second time made with tasso - not easy to find in Oklahoma I can tell you! Now that makes a difference. FYI Okies La Baguette Bistro and Boucherie carries tasso.
