This is my first time making homemade ranch, so I don't have other recipes to compare it to. I didn't have fresh cilantro, so I used 1 tablespoon dried cilantro instead. I thought the flavor was great. I love garlic, so the 1 tablespoon minced garlic (6 gloves) was not one bit overpowering. I wouldn't mind putting more in! Also, as you can expect, letting it sit gives it better flavor!

Reduced garlic by more than half and it's excellent. Used also as a sandwich spread

Best Ranch dressing ever. I omitted cilantro and red pepper. Used two cloves of garlic rather than 1 TBSP. Also used homemade mayo from Mark Bittman's recipe.

This dressing is so easy to make and easy to adjust to personal tastes of your family. I will never buy a bottled ranch dressing again.

I made this recipe in a blender which worked quite well. It's better after sitting for about 12 hours BUT 1 TBSP of garlic is overpowering. Next time I'll cut it in half.
