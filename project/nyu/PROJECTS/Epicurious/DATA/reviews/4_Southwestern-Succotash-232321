This is a very nice side. It is hard to get something besides Spanish rice as a side dish for Mexican food. This is now my "go to". Not too much prep but worth the time you do spend.

Made this last Thanksgiving (substituted baby limas for the zucchini)and it was such a big hit that it was requested by a lima-bean-hating friend who is joining us at the holiday table again this year. If you can turn a lima- hater into a succotash lover, you must have a good recipe on your hands!

I can't believe only 4 people have reviewed this dish. It's fabulous! We found a few summers ago, when squash were plentiful in the garden, and look forward to it every year. Try it with grilled meats. When making it for company I prepare everything up to the last step and then all I have to do is reheat and stir in the fianl ingredients.

This was delicious and easy to make (takes a bit of time to roast the peppers). Will definitely make again!

This is a great, unique summer recipe. It makes more servings than 8, which is not a problem around here.

I thougth this recipe was easy and very tasty. I had most of the ingredients at home and used all garden grown vegetables. Will definitely make it again!
