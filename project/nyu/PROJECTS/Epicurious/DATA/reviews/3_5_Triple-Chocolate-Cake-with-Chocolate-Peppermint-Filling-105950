I added 1/8th of a teaspoon extra peppermint extract to the cake batter and it was perfectly minty - in fact it helped to cut through the cloying sweetness of the chocolate. I also crushed the peppermint candies very fine to dust the cake with (easier to bite into that the big pieces) and used some of the bigger pieces as garnish. The sugared mint leaves were beautiful and added a lovely freshness to the small bites they added to. In the future, I'd make about 1/2 cup more glaze in order to thickly and fully cover the whole cake. I may also use slightly less sugar and instead use applesauce - it's an extremely sweet cake all in all, and some way to cut that would be great. Also, be very careful when you're baking the cake. I made two, 9-inch by 1-inch cakes and baked them separately - and it definitely didn't take an hour and five minutes. They were done about 45-50 minutes in. I would suggest that you test the cake closer to the edge AS WELL AS in the middle to make sure the edges are being baked evenly. Also be sure to really allow at least 5 hours to come to room temperature if you've made it the day prior, or it will be quite stiff when you cut it. All in all, everyone loved it. It was beautiful and kept well, and tasted outstanding. It's really dense and kept my dad up all night because of the sheer volume of chocolate in it. Job well done per everyone at Christmas dinner. :)

I've made this cake in three versions. The peppermint recipe was fabulous at Christmas. Once I substituted the mini chips with an equal amount of chopped Andes mints which turned out beautifully. Just yesterday I made the cake without the glaze or peppermint flavoring but added raspberry pastry filling over the ganache filling, frosted it with a chocolate buttercream and covered it with a vanilla fondant for a colleague's retirement from nursing. Everyone at worked raved about it and thought it came from a bakery!

I also had a problem with the cake not rising and found it rather dry - although the mini chocolate chips seemed to help. I also thought that the dessert was fairly one-dimensional. Raspberries help to break up the chocolate. That being said, both the filling and the glaze were tasty with the mint extract.

This cake is perfect for holiday entertaining. I made it for my gourmet club. I was a little nervous because the reviews were either very good or very bad, but I wanted something festive. I took suggestions from many reviewers..I used (2) 9' springform pans, baked at 350 for 25 minutes and cut the peppermint in the glaze to 1/2 tsp. The cake was very dense and very moist. It was worth the time invested.

Absolutely delicious! A Christmas keeper! There was actually a bit of tension over who took the last piece! I think the problem everyone is having is not beating the cake enough to get desired volume and over baking. Beat this cake alot! The batter is delicious as well. I turned down the temp to around 340, used two pans that were plenty full, and after 30 minutes I watched very very carefully testing every five minutes with a clean knife. Do NOT over bake. It was perfect, moist, delicious. The minis melt and flow into an airy cake. The stunner of this cake is the icing and how it perfectly compliments the interior of the cake. I'm so sad it's all gone now. The touch of mint was absolutely to die for! I used a light grazing of crushed candycanes all over the top, looked very festive, set well and quickly and tasted wonderful. No big pieces. I will definitely make this again next Christmas.

Just made this cake for Christmas dessert. I made two other desserts and this one came in 3rd. I found it to be dry and rather heavy and dense. I prefer lighter cakes, not sure this will make the cut for next year.

I tried making the cake in two 9" rounds instead of one larger one, so it wouldn't have to cook as long, but frankly I think the culprits adding to dryness are the mini chocolate chips - they keep the cake cooking too long after you take it out. Love the filling part of the recipe, but the rest wasn't great.

I made this cake for Christmas Eve dinner, and thought it was just OK. The filling was good- not too minty, which was good, because I'm not a huge fan of peppermint (my family is!) The cakes themselves were just not that great- maybe if I make it again, I'll use a boxed cake mix, and make the filling and frosting from this recipe.

Made as two 9" cakes - 23 min cooking time. Made the filling with white chocolate and chilled for 30 min before whipping to a stiff consistancy. Used 1/2 instead of 3/4 mint in the ganache. Decorated with white chocolate curls. It was fabulous, everyone loved it. It is not complicated, the ganache is probably the trickiest because though it seemed quite runny, when it hit the chilled cake it hardened up very fast. Thanks to previous reviewer I was expecting this and had the curls ready to go on top immediately. I didn't do a chill after the crumb layer, wasn't necessary as it solidified so fast. Yum, I highly recommend it!

Rating: 4
It was a bit of work but very good. I love the mix of chocolate and mint. I had to make 2 cakes so I tried one cake baked in one pan and one in 2 pans. The cake in 2 pans worked out better because the one pan method (at least in my oven) dried out a bit on the edges before the middle was set. The 2 pan method made for a very moist and rich cake. I also mis-read the recipe and neglected to whip the filling. It was fine anyway and added to the rich and decadent nature of the cake. Excellent with mint chip ice cream. I'll make this again!!

Rating: 4
This was delicious, rich, and could serve more than 12, due to the richness of the cake. I would make it again, but would try other reviewers's suggestions to cook in more layers, for less time, rather than one big cake which is split. The glaze is fabulous. The filling is also good, although I preferred the bittersweet-chocolate glaze. I couldn't find mini-chips and used regular sized chips, but mini chips would be better for the cake's texture. I also would cut the amount of chips to 1 C. rather than 1 1/2 C.; there's already more than enough chocolate. (In fact, the filling was more than needed; I saved the rest to use as an ice cream sauce later.)

I've made this cake 3 times since Xmas. It's easy to make, but time consuming. The cake itself is somewhat dry, but the creamy filling and lucious glaze make it work. It is overbaked at 65 min.; I now bake it only 40-45 min. as suggested below. Follow another cook's tip: use crushed candy canes - they're more red - and press into the glaze before it firms up, which it does rather quickly. Crisco made no difference in the glaze; it was shiny with or without it. A friend thought this cake tasted like a giant peppermint patty. It's the perfect ratio of chocolate to mint for my taste. Divine.

This is a wonderful chocolate cake. Despite many recommendations to cook in two pans...I wouldn't do it. That gives you too much "crust" part of cake and lessens the cake/filling combination in my view. It is not a difficult cake to split. I did use crisco recommendation! Everyone loved the cake, and it looked beautiful.

Made this for the big family christmas get-together and it was a huge hit (with both the kids and the adults). Very rich, but the mint helps keep it from being overpowering... nice presentation, too. I doubled the recipe and used 3 9" pans to make a 3-layer cake, which worked well.

Definitely Decadent & Delicious! The triple chocolate cake is triple delicious! I made this for Christmas & it was a hit. I followed some reviewers suggestions - used 2 9" pans & cut the baking time to 25-30 min. This worked perfectly - no reason to fuss with 1 pan & then cutting it in half. Also, I did not have a pan with 2" sides, so this alleviated going out & buying one. If the filling cools & thickens too much for spreading, I just placed the bowl on the top of the warm stove (not the burner!) & stirred it, that was just enough to loosen the filling. I also added 1 TBSP Crisco to the glaze to give it some shine.This does take some time to make - at least 1 1/2 hours total .

Cake was very dry and heavy. A big disapointment after all that hard work for a Christmas party. It was a lot of work to make this and it was not worth the time. If you like the idea, I would go the boxed cake route and add in the additional items to make the holiday cake you are looking for.

This is a wonderful cake! I microwaved the chocolate for a bit to help melt it and that worked out well. One thing that happened when frosting it was that it set way too fast over the crumb coat and it wouldn't spread down the sides.

I'm 13 and it took me a few hours to make this cake and I can tell you it was a hit! I started catering for private parties and offered this cake among my menu(espessially for holidays) If someone doesn't like a peppermint flavor in there food subsituting with a little more chocolate isn't bad at all. As a matter of fact, you can subsitute anything from rum to rasins and it would work well with many crowds. Two thumbs up!

Loved this recipe! the filling and glaze made the cake very moist and rich. i doubled the cake, put it in 3 pans, and made a layer cake. i had no problem with overflow; the edges baked first, of course, and sort of rose above the pan, creating an extension for the cake to bake in. after it was done, it shrunk a little, and turned out perfectly. will definitely make this again.

Just made this for New Year's, very nice presentation and the mint candies on top were a huge hit! I made it in 2, 7-inch cake pans because I thought that would be easier that cutting the cake in half, and drastically reduced the cooking time (about 40-45 minutes, tops). Will probably make again, but have a recipe for chocolate-mint brownies that is much easier and has same taste.

I didn't make the cake, but I made the filling and the glaze. The filling was very blah - too sweet, not minty enough, and not very interesting (I used a high-quality milk chocolate). The glaze was quite good, but I would have preferred a traditional dark chocolate ganache.

Made this yesterday for Christmas dinner and it was great. Definitely rich -- a sliver will satisfy most people. Contrary to the experience of other bakers, mine fit perfectly into a 9" pan (with 2" sides). I'm wondering if others might have beat it longer, thus incorporating more air and resulting in greater volume of batter? And, although the crushed peppermint candies on top make the cake, appearance-wise, I scraped mine off when I ate it. Just didn't want them to interfere with the creaminess of the cake. Also, I think they should be added right after the last layer of glaze; otherwise they kind of fall off the cake if you put them on after the glaze has hardened. It was a gorgeous, delicious, and festive-looking cake.

My kids loved this cake; I did,too, but it is very rich. This will probably be my daughter's birthday cake forevermore. I followed the recipe, except I used less crushed peppermint on the top and I couldn't find mini-chips for the cake batter. I used the regular size and tried to chop them a bit smaller. I think the mini-chips would work better - too much large chocolate was in the bottom layer. I used bittersweet chocolate for the glaze. I used a springform pan to accomodate the height implied by "2 inch high cake pan" but the cake didn't rise to 2 inches.

Although I loved the end result of this recipe, there were a few things that make me worry along the way. I followed the recipe word for word and tried to cook it all in one 9 inch pan and had major overflow problems. I read the recipe three times to make sure I was reading the directions correctly...so beware. I just read someone else's advice about using 2 pans...I will next time. Also, I was concerned after I let the cake cool for several hours before slicing in half. The bottom of the cake was total solid and dry. I worried it would be too tough for people to eat. If you ever have this concern, understand it all works itself out as the filling and glaze have a chance to soak in. I loved this cake and will definitly make again since I love chocolate and peppermint!

This cake is fast becoming our family's celebration cake. My sister even had this as her groom's cake at their wedding--the guests raved over it. I'm making it again today for a 6-yr. old's birthday . . . I've made it once using the actual cake recipe, and it was great. Now, I make a good dark chocolate cake and use this filling/glaze. Be sure you use quality chocolate, not just Hershey's (as I tried to do in a pinch--it didn't set right and was too sweet). Enjoy!

Wow! The best cake ever created for us chocolate lovers! The peppermint was a perfect mate as well! I made this for Christmas dinner, and started a lot of it 2 days prior, as I knew I would be especially busy cooking other things on the big day. I'd make it again, but it sure is a labor intensive cake, and it's hard to find that kind of time any more!

I am not a great baker, but I took the advice others left on the site and my cake came out beautifully. All 8 guests loved it. The 12-year-old called it "the best cake" she's ever had!

The triple combo: cake, glaze and peppermint make for an outstanding recipe. Perfect for making a day in advance. Multi-steps are slightly time- consuming, but worth the effort. The process was much easier than I expected. Have made it three times. And if the cake does not come out quite right, as is not that unusual when baking, don't worry---the glaze can repair any damage. Broken peppermint candy canes are great for decorating sides of cake dish. Enjoy!

Didn't read the reviews before I made this; had no problems and followed directions as they were. I loved it, as did my family; I wasn't too sure about the peppermint as I'm not that much of a mint fan, but with the chocolate it was good. Too rich for my in-laws taste, but that just left more for me. I'll definitely make this again.

hmmm. the idea of peppermint in a chocolate cake didn't really thrill me, but my nephew loves peppermint patties, so of course the doting aunt in me had to make this cake! the number of reviewers who had problems was a bit daunting. ::shrug:: this is a really easy cake to make. just -- as so many have suggested -- drastically reduce the cooking time. also, i made it as cupcakes. the little cupcake papers made life much easier, and i just used a pastry bag to squirt the filling in (hostess cupcake style). one suggestion for the filling -- beat it waaaaay longer than 30 seconds, and it will set up just fine. it was girl scout "thin mint" good, but next time i make this cake, i'm thinking of substituting coffee for the peppermint, and chopped chocolate-covered coffee beans for the chocolate chips. doesn't that sound yummy?

Delish, and beautiful. Saved the night, as my other dessert (eggnog creme brulee) was a total flop.

Rave reviews!!

Actually a pretty tasty cake, and not all that difficult to make, but a lot of effort for the build. In the end, no one got to excited about the peppermint - just a bit too much of that, and were I to make this again, I would probably put mint only in either the filling or the glaze, but not both. Working the glaze is tricky...

I made this for a friend who loves mint-chocolate chip ice cream (which we can't get here in Europe, unless we make our own.) It was a huge hit! The only one who didn't like it was a three-year-old who wasn't expecting that minty bite. Having no chocolate chips here in Europe, I chopped up a mixture of the Lindt dark chocolate and milk chocolate which worked fine. Of course I divided the cake mixture into two pans to bake it (and reduced the cooking time accordingly). Is there anybody who actually enjoys cutting a cake in half horizontally? As a previous reviewer said, this cake really is like a giant chocolate-mint Girl Scout cookie.

I brought this cake to work and it received rave reviews. I used 2 nine inch pans and only baked the cake about 30 min. I chilled the filling while the cake was baking, then whipped it prior to spreading it on and it worked out perfectly. I also added 2 tablespoons of Crisco to the glaze as another reader suggested and my glaze was shiny just like the picture. I will definitely make this recipe again!!!! The extra time required is well worth it.

Excellent cake. It reminds me of Girl Scout thin mint cookies. I would recommend cutting the glaze ingredients in half, since it's a bit much with the full amount. This cake goes a long way. It's so rich that all you need is a tiny slice. I'd test it for 'doneness' after about 45-50 min.

I didn't think this cake was all that great. My husband is a big chocolate cake fan and thought it was just okay - we both agreed the filling had a weird taste. Definitely not worth all the time and hassle. I'm going to try the glaze with some other chocolate cake recipes since we both liked the peppermint flavor.

I made this cake for Valentine's Day. It was delicious and very rich. I recommend halving the serving sizes to make 24 servings since it is very rich.

Tastes like a giant thin mint girl scout cookie!

I've made this cake 2 times now. Because it's so rich a little goes a long way. The dry problem can be somewhat solved by using a pan with 3" sides and shiny metal. Dark nonstick pans tend to brown sides and cook things faster.(available wherever cake decorating products are sold) The 3" will allow the cake to "pull" up the sides more and give you a fuller/taller cake. More like the picture shows. I would also chill the filling until ready to use. The first time I made this I did what the recipe said but it was too runny and the cake top slid around. The 2nd time I chilled it before I put it in the cake and it was perfect. I was like the picture showed, 1' of pure filling and it made the cake even taller. The shiny problem can be solved by adding 1-2 Tbsp plain Crisco(solid)to the glaze. That's an old bakery secret. Will make again now that I know some tips and what to expect.

I was a little apprehensive about making this recipe but once I got started I found it was really quite easy (just a bit time consuming). The finished dessert is well worth the time.

It was wonderful! Unlike so many other reviews, my cake actually took longer then expected. I also found there to be too much batter for the 9 inch round (oh, what a mess I had). I'm going to make it again this weekend as it was such a hit. The benefits to living in Chicago is that you can use the garage for a cooler. I just kept taking it in and out of the garage and never had to touch the refrigerator. Invest the time and the money to buy high quality chocolate...it's worth it!

This cake baked much less than the recipe called for. It was very dense and heavy, but delish. Outside was rather crispy. I omitted peppermint flavoring altogether (blah!); tasted great.

I found this recipe fairly straight forward and easy to make. The presentation was lovely. The first few bites were very good - just like a rich and delicious truffle.

I made this cake for a New Years Eve dessert along with the Roasted Pear and Amaretto Trifle. They were both a huge hit. My husband had the trifle first and thought it was so good he wasn't going to try the cake. When he did he liked it even better! I took the reviewers suggestions and bake it in 2 pans for 25 minutes. That worked well and I'm sure was less messy than trying to slice the cake. I found that after chilling the glaze was a bit dull, not at all glossy. Next time I may try another glaze recipe. I also had trouble with the mint leaves being limp. I used them anyway and everyone thought the cake looked wonderful. This cake is very rich and will serve many more than 12.

Will make this again and again, judging from the partygoers' reactions. But, can someone tell me how to get those sugared mint leaf decorations to actually work? Most came out limp and unusable so I ended up just using the mint leaves without sugar. Any hints? Anyhow, this recipe was a big hit!!

I've made this twice - both times worked perfectly. I cut back a bit on the peppermint extract the second time. Also, the second time, the only milk chocolate I could find was a huge bar of hersheys - not what you usually think of for cooking. What the heck, I used it, and it still turned out great.

Wonderful minty taste. I baked it in a 9 inch springform for an hour, and mine burnt , too. The cake seemed a bit dry. Next time I'd reduce the baking time. Not really difficult to make - just takes a few steps.

Made this for Christmas dinner. It turned out a bit denser (flatter)that it appeared in the magazine but it tasted great. Impressive and a bit time-consuming but not overly difficult.

Very good. Very Chocolatey. We mixed other choclates with the imported ones and it came out great. It is easy to make asnd tastes great. I am 14 and did it by myself. Family loved it. Kind of hard to cut because of the hardend chocolate inside and on top.

Two of our guests are allergic to peppermint, so I used almond extract instead and received rave reviews. I topped the cake with World's Finest Chocolate Chocolate Covered Almonds. This recipe will be a holiday tradition in the future, and some lucky friends might get this as an extra special birthday cake.

This was a wonderful recipe loved by all at our Christmas dinner - I seldom bake and was thrilled with how well this turned out. It looks and tastes impressive but really is not very difficult. I also used 2 9" pans and baked each layer for 20 minutes - they were perfect.

One of the best cakes I've ever tasted - simply delicious (and it looks beautiful!) Not too hard to make, either. Everyone loved this dessert!

Very good and great with vanilla ice cream. Cake is dense but not dry and keeps well in the fridge for days.

This cake was a huge hit at my Christmas dinner! Everyone loved it and thought it was gorgeous! I used whole peppermint candies (the round ones) and did the sugared mint leaves, too... Put it on a big red serving plate... I have to congratulate myself, it was GORGEOUS. I too did the two pans, but evidently judged the cooking time BADLY. I baked two pans for 35 minutes and the edges were BURNED AND HARD! Luckily, my improvising-cook boyfriend stepped in (as I was hysterically preparing to throw the cake in the trash) and we cut a smaller cake out of the center using a bowl. I was terrified it was going to be too dry and yucky... but I had a piece and it was GOOOOOODDD... tasted like a Thin Mint cookie. Yummmmmy! So pretty, so tasty... definitely a keeper!

This is an exellent dessert. My guests loved it! I wish I would have read the reviews before I made it. I will definitely make with 2 9" pans next time. Cutting the cake proved difficult and fell apart slightly. Of course, with my limited baking skills it still turned out very nicely!

This cake is beautiful to look at and delicious to taste. Next time, I would slightly under-cook it for chewiness, but other than that wouldn't change anything about it. I served it with vanilla ice cream, and sprinkled it with candy canes that were ground using a mortar and pestle - delish! It's a great holiday treat.

The cake was easier than some of the other reviews would have suggested. I also split the batter between 2 9" pans and baked for about 25 minutes. Best-grade chocolate makes a big difference. This will be an annual Christmas dessert.

Yes, it's true that this cake is a little involved to make, but it's worth the effort. I agree with previous reviewers that the cake will be done at about 50 mintues, and that going as long as the recipe calls for would be a disaster. For those of you familiar with the Frango Mints from Marshall Fields department stores, to me this cake tastes like a frango mint cake; to my husband, it reminded him of the Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies - either way, not too shabby! However, there were those at my holiday table who don't care for the taste of mint and for them this cake is lost on them - bah humbug!

Delicious filling and glaze. Alas, my cake burned the first time. Wish the recipe would have read two 9" pans at 20-25 min.

Excellent holiday cake! It looks great when finished with the glaze on it. I made it in 2 9inch pans and baked for 20-25 minutes. Much easier than cutting one in half.

I loved this cake but alas, not everyone loved the chocolate-mint flavor. How could they not - it's chocolate, it's mint -- it's like a giant, rich, really chocolatey Peppermint Patty!

I love this recipe! It is a great-but quite rich-hoilday cake and the presentation itself gets people talking. I reduced the cooking time to 50-53 minutes which was perfect and I can't believe how much fun I had with the glaze. It is a simple enough recipe for anyone to try, but give yourself a good chunk of the day to get it done. I am making it again for Christmas eve, thanks for the great recipe!

I made this cake for a friend's birthday, she raved about it so much, I had to make one for her co-worker. I baked the batter in 2 9" pans for 20-25 min & they came out perfect. Plus, you don't have to slice the cake in half.

This was a wonderfully rich holiday indulgence. Raves at the dinner party that I brought it to! Probably could have cut down the cooking time 10 min., seemed overcooked at edges after cooling, but fine once glaze was on cake.

NOTE - this cake is very, very sweet and rich! Even my chocoholic in-laws felt it was too much. The cake was delicious by itself but was overwhelmed by the filling and glaze. I would definitely make it again but would skip the filling.

This recipe was great! It is a lot of work but definently worth it! Instead of putting smashed candy canes on top I put mini ones on. This is great for parties.

Made this for a Christmas party and got rave reviews and I consider myself and average baker. Easy recipe, readily available ingredients, easy t o assemble and beautiful. The perfect dessert. Now if it were only lo-cal,...sigh. Definately a keeper.

This is a great cake to serve for the Holidays. Just be careful on the cooking time. I followed the recipe the first time and it seemed burnt. When I reduced the cooking time by about 5-10 minutes it came out much better and everyone loved it!

This cake was made as a sheet cake for a surprise birthday party. Perhaps the best chocolate cake I have ever had! Many of those attending asked for the recipe. Highly recommended.
