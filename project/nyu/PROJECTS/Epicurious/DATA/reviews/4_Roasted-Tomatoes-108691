For the BEST roasted tomato recipe see Epicurious recipe: "SPICY ROAST CHICKEN WITH TOMATOES AND MARJORAM", lose the chicken (ordinary) and do the tomatoes alone, just adjust the time to about 20-25 minutes. I use grape tomatoes and like to add chopped onion and a little balsamic vinegar. Adjust the red pepper flakes to taste. In the absence of marjoram other dried or fresh herbs are fine. Try it, the method and basic ingredients are are a great starting point. The tomatoes are roasted but still have integrity and the flavors are good. Nice side dish.

Absolutely the best way ever to eat tomatoes. These are delicious. One tip though - watch the tomatoes carefully as they cook, as mine definately didn't take 50 minutes and you don't want them to burn.
