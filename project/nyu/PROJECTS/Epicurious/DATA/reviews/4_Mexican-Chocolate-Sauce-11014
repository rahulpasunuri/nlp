So easy to make! Used a recommended substitution for the mexican chocolate (2 tsp cinnamon and 8 drops almond extract per 8oz chocolate) because I had those supplies on-hand and mexican chocolate was not available in my standard grocery stores. Love, love love! Used 60% cacao; roommate prefers milk chocolate.

Make this sauce ahead of time to serve over ice cream, cakes or pies. I like to add a little to a glass of coffee after dinner.
