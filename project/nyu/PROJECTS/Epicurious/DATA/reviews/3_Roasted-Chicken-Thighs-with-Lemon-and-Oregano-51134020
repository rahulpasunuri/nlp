This was good... I don't like dark meat chicken and was going to use breasts, but my store didn't have them that day so I did use the thighs. I will try the breasts next time. I felt that it needed to be cooked a bit longer, I did about 15 in on the stove and 15 in the oven as well. The tip about starting with the room temp skillet worked really well, the chicken skin was nicely browned.

This was an ugly mess. Sounds good in theory but this is NOT the way to go about it. Followed the recipe exactly and ended up basically, with boiled chicken. Way too much work for something that was just barely edible.

Yes, the recipe was poorly written when it comes to the steps to make and keep the skin crispy. There is a "perfect pan-roasted chicken thighs" recipe that delineates that very clearly. I followed those steps and then finished it up by making the sauce and it turned up delicious.

Very poorly written recipe. Lots of steps with poor results. Thighs were undercooked and there is no explanation of how to serve the sauce. About the worst recipe I have read on this site.

This was very good and easy. Don't eat the lemons IMHO. I did use more lemons (3) because even thinly sliced I needed more lemons under the chicken. I will make it again.

This was an excellant mid week meal. I followed the directions perfectly and used my cast iron skillet. Chicken was crispy and sauce was thick and lemony. I served it with a side of pilaf and sauteed spinach. Its added to the routine for sure!

This recipe is not well written, and no one bothered to proofread it. Example: "Remove skillet from heat. Add wine; cook over medium heat until reduced by half..."? As several reviews have noted, the roasting time is off -- 8 minutes is how long I cook chicken thighs in a pressure cooker, not an oven. It took me 20 minutes to roast my small (1/4 lb) thighs, but the lemon slices begin to char at about 10 minutes. Also, I had little difficulty browning the skin by this method. It took about 8 minutes with my pan - burner combination. Those of you that failed should try more heat next time. Still it tasted good,

I would give this 4 forks but as other reviewers mentioned the skin does not get crisp with this method and I was very careful to pour out the fat during Step 1. At the step where the recipe says to put the chicken aside and make the sauce I put the chicken under the broiler to crisp the skin. The sauce is EXCELLENT. Make double the sauce recipe because you will want to dip bread or pour over your side. I will certainly make again.

Chicken took much longer to cook than recipe called for. I used 4 small chicken thighs so it all cooked up in one skillet. Skin did not get crispy. Would need to put under broiler maybe for a few minutes to get it to crisp up. The sauce was very good; will probably use that on chicken breasts next time rather than thighs.

Fantastic recipe. Very easy to make. I also adapted it for duck - YUM!

I forgot to add that I cooked it in the oven AFTER I took it off the cooktop.

A couple of changes... I dredged the chicken in seasoned flour and cooked in the oven 30 minutes. My cast iron skillet was perfect for this. The skin was great and after all, isn't that why we eat chicken?

If the skin had actually come out crispy, I would have given this 4 stars. It was crispy going into the oven (though draining the excess fat from the pan was tricky), but when it was done cooking in the oven the skin was no longer crispy, I'm guessing due to the chicken and the lemons releasing too much liquid into the bottom of the pan. I still give it 3 stars, though, because chicken still tasted lovely and the sauce was WONDERFUL. Silky, lemony, tasty. Glad I resisted the urge to substitute thyme for the oregano. Other than that, I found the cooking times to be pretty accurate. Very nice dish. Better if the skin had stayed crisp.

Not spectacular, and I so wanted it to be. Also took MUCH longer to cook those chicken thighs than the 18 minutes proposed here.

I made this without having an oven safe skillet so I had to transfer back and forth between the skillet and an oven safe baking dish. That aside, it was delicious. Chicken was tender and skin crispy. Excellent lemon flavor with accents of the shallots and garlic.

The recipe didn't tell you up front that it needed an oven proof frying pan to hold all the pieces at once. Doing the pieces in batches defeats the purpose of using the room temp pan. Non-fussy family ate the soggy chicken anyway.

These were quite delicious - excellent combination of flavors! The sauce was quite yummy drizzled over mashed potatoes and sautéed spinach.

I was SO disappointed with this recipe. I followed it exactly and the thighs were the most bland I've ever made. Lots of production, very little payback. My husband and I love to cook so its not like we didn't know how to follow the recipe. Overall, a complete waste of time and chicken!

I've made plenty of lemon chicken recipes over the years, but this was the first in which the lemon flavor really seemed to permeate the meat. We could not stop eating it. Excellent recipe.
