This has become our favorite calzone. I use deli ham instead of proscuitto, and I just lay the slices onto the rolled-out dough before topping with the cheese filling.

This was a really good, easy weeknight meal. My boyfriend liked it so much we didn't have any leftovers! I used Trader Joe's whole wheat pizza dough and part-skim mozzarella to keep it healthy. Next time I will try adding additional ingredients such as caramelized onions and sun dried tomatoes as other members have suggested.

we divided our pizza dough (from trader joes) in 3. This made the crust thin and crispy. We made one with gruyere/swiss & smoked mozz., chanterelles & oyster mushrooms, spinach, and carmelized onions. We made one exactly per the recipe with the goat cheese - distinctly divine. Amazing! best use of a trader joe's pizza dough ;)

Super easy and delicious. I ended up adding mushrooms and a tomato based dipping sauce, but would probably add caramelized onions next time too.

This is so easy and so good! I make it alllll the time ... to rave reviews every time. Serve with a salad and you are set for a simple dinner.

Incredibly simple to make - the most difficult part was getting the pizza dough out of its tube! You could use bacon or pancetta instead of prosciutto, all taste great. I've added some caramelized onions, which are a great addition. However; I usually don't vary this recipe much, as it's perfect as-is.

Terrific and quick week-night meal. We substituted a few items based on what we had in the frig...shrimp in place of ham and we used a mix of goat, manchego and mozzarella (yum). We added fresh basil and rosemary and sundried tomatoes that a reviewer recommended. The garlic and onion suggestion on the crust was awesome.

This is delicious and very easy to make! At the suggestion of other reviewers, I added a caramelized onion, though I honestly think it would be delicious with or without the onion. There was so much flavor, we didn't even need the spicy marinara served alongside. Will definitely make this again, and would be confident serving it to guests.

A great, easy recipe. Used 2-ounces grated smoked gouda cheese instead of goat cheese.Sprayed top with Pam,lightly sprinkle with garlic powder and topped with thinly sliced red onion.Carefully sliced into 6 pieces.Perfect!

Ive made this several times. The past few times I have skimped on the thyme and the recipe was still good! Today I served as the recipe calls w/ thyme ... unbelievable! I also sprinkled powedered garlic on the pizza dough before baking. Absolutely delicious! I recommend mincing the garlic clove instead of pressing.

Between the goat cheese and the proscuitto, this was too salty for our taste.

I made my own pizza dough from another recipe I found here. This is nothing less than "TASTY" Loved it!

Terrific for a VERY quick weeknight dinner ... really stuffs the dough and is quite flavorful. Lots of room to get creative with your favorite cheeses and stuffing ingredients!

I followed the directions and it came out great! The only thing is that it's pretty rich. I may make my own crust next time and use a little less cheese.

A wonderful cheesy dish best served with a simple green salad! I added 1 cup thinly sliced onions, 1 cup fresh sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup of sun-dried tomatoes, 2 extra cloves of fresh garlic, and crushed red pepper to taste. *Brown the prosciutto, mushrooms, and onions in saucepan before adding to calzone mixture.

Really liked this. Quick and easy and tasty. Fed two generously with enough left to heat up for lunch. Also made a quick chunky marinara sauce which added to the meal. Will definitely make again. May have used a little more cheese than called for - it was pretty well stuffed.

My brother was craving a calzone, but I wanted to use my own dough, so I used the dough recipe from the calzones with cheese, sausage, and roasted red pepper - which worked great. This filling recipe looked better though, and it was perfect. My brother could not stop raving. I ended up with a ton of extra dough and was able to make more filling for another calzone. For the next three days we would slice off a bit and heat it in the oven, and it was very much loved every time. I doubled the prosciutto and took out some of the goat cheese, which worked well. I also had to omit the garlic due to an allergy, but otherwise I would have used it. I'll definately use this again if anyone wants calzones.

Quick and easy. Don't skimp on the goat cheese. The flavor really adds to the meal. Absolutely use fresh mozzeralla. Adding vegetables make this a complete meal. Yum!

Quick and easy. Don't skimp on the goat cheese. This adds a lot of flavor. I did add canned red peppers and onions as suggested below. Yum!

Easy and delicious! I added carmelized onions and diced red pepper (from a jar). The flavors blended together nicely. Good cheese is vital!

My first epicurious experience was an excellent one. This dish was incredibly quick and simple but tasted amazing. I tried mine with grilled red pepper and onion. Will certainly make it again.

A good, quick filling dish, along with a salad, for a weekday dinner and one to have fun with. We made it just as written the first time and tweaked it a little the second. Caramelized onions and white truffle oil instead of EVOO gave it a sweet earthiness along with the thyme. Paired it with a pinot noir for a little more fullness. We'll keep making it with whatever combination of fillings come to mind. A fun recipe.

I thought this was good as is but is also open to tweeking. Fresh mozarella is a must. The dried stuff that comes in blocks just won't do. You won't believe the taste difference when using fresh. I would use the full amount of goat cheese, the flavor is wonderful. Vegetables could be added such as roasted red peppers, spinach, and so on.

This was good and extremely easy to prepare. Next time I make it I would use half the amount of goat cheese. It is very rich and filling!

I thought this was okay. To me it tasted a bit dry and I actually dipped mine in pizza sauce. I didn't brush my dough with oil however. I didn't understand the purpose in brushing the calzone with oil AFTER you bake it, so I skipped that. And to be honest, I thought it was too much goat cheese. Goat cheese is very flavorful and I think it's a wonderful accent to dishes. But it's better in my opinion as an accent here and there. I will say I only had on hand a goat cheese log although I crumbled it up- not sure if that made a difference.

My family and I loved this! First, it takes all of 2 minutes to prep. Second, the flavors are awesome. I did fiddle a bit with the recipe. Proscuttio isn't availabe in my local deli so I bought it in a presealed 4 oz pack and used it all.... Ditto for the goat cheese, and since an herbed variety was on sale (I bought it) and ommitted the thyme. Would be super for a casual supper with friends!

I've made it twice, once with pepperoni and once with sopressata, both times adding a couple chopped roasted red peppers to the filling. I used Trader Joe's pre-made dough, and I once used the whole wheat and once the white. I thought the whole wheat was easier to handle and was tasty too! I made it once for a friend and once for a superbowl party, and everyone loved it!
