I made modifications and was very pleased with the result. I doubled the recipe to make a 15x10 LAYER cake, which I baked in Pyrex pans lined with a parchment sleeve to aid in removal (SO glad I did that). Since I doubled the recipe I used 1 c. hot coffee and 1 C. water, which I brought to boil with the butter & sifted cocoa. I beat the sugar and oil w/ the eggs until fluffy, added the buttermilk and vanilla then combined all the dry ingredients (including 2 tsp. cinnamon) in a separate bowl. I scooped out about 1/4 c. of the flour mixture and combined that with Ghirardelli 60% cacao bittersweet choc. chips (that helps 'em not sink). I added the dry ingred to the wet then stirred in the choc chip/flour mixture & poured into my pans. They baked about 25 min. Be very careful that you don't accidentally add some frosting ingred to cake batter; recipe as written is deceiving. For the frosting (which I also doubled) I used 2 sticks of very soft (not melted) butter, 1.5 lbs. of sugar sifted together w/ 6 Tbs. cocoa powder, 1/3 c. each of buttermilk & lowfat milk, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 c. sour cream and a hefty half of a stick of softened cream cheese. I beat the heck out of it in my mixer using the whisk attachment until it was fluffy and light. I think the addition of sour cream/cream cheese, as well as the ommission of half a lb. of powd. sugar, kept the frosting from being too sweet. It is a VERY soft frosting, so I waited until the cakes were cool and removed from pan to frost. I also stuck the frosting in the fridge to harden up a bit. It SOUNDS like a pain but the net result was worth the nominal effort, especially since it's easily made a day in advance. I took it to a birthday party and it easily served 20 and got rave reviews. Yes, it's a zillion calorie chocolate bomb but totally worth it for a special occasion.

I liked this cake, but I would highly recommend doubling the recipe to fit the pan, otherwise the cake comes out about as flat as a pancake.

Made this for a 7-year-old's birthday party with 22 kids. HUGE hit. Put it in a 10" x 15" 'pan' (actually a cardboard box for $3 purchased at a posh baking supply store). Substituted regular milk w/1 tsp vinegar for buttermilk. Cut the sugar in half. Forgot chips on top. Originally doubled the recipe to fit the pan, but it scarcely covered the bottom, so made another double batch, and it filled it all the way up. That was a bit much, next time I'd only triple the recipe for that size pan. Baked it for 50 minutes at 325. Came out perfectly - so moist and fudgy. and just the right amount of sweetness. Exactly as another reviewer put it: a cross between a brownie and a cake. Used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips for a ganache-type frosting. The kids actually ate it, and told their parents how good the cake was! I'm still sending out copies of the recipe.

Everyone loved it. The way the recipe is made is strange, though. Whisk softened butter with water (I don't use margarine)? Impossible. I used a hand mixer and it splattered all over. Next time I will use melted butter. Aside from that it was easy to put together.

I've made this cake for childrens' birthday parties several times - always a big hit. Easy to pull together at the last minute. The icing is much too sweet, however.

I made this cake for my office and my coworkers loved it. Like someone else here, I made it in a 10x13 pyrex dish, and I baked it for 35 minutes. The cake is very sweet and rich - it would probably be great with less sugar and cocoa. The icing recipe was easy and good, but way too sweet for me. I will reduce the sugar in the future.

My son and his friends love this cake recipe. It is one of the fastest to make/always gets rave reviews desserts I make. I bring it to other events frequently. A few suggested changes: use really good chocolate chips if you can, toast the nuts under the broiler before topping the cake, and I've used real buttermilk, Sacco's dried buttermilk, and skim milk soured with 1 tsp of vinegar and with all have had great results.

I liked this recipe and took it to a church function where it was a big hit. It's really easy and has a great flavor. I made a few changes however. I added a little sour cream to the frosting, and I used honey roasted pecans, which were a bit richer.

Delicious and moist cake - even w/o any frosting. I followed suggestion to substitute apple sauce for all of the oil, and used butter instead of the margarine. Next time I will melt the butter with the water as suggested by others. Also, I would reduce the sugar a bit (to compensate for the applesauce's sweetness) and add extra cocoa.

Cake is GREAT and easy. Followed the recipe exactly. Used a buttercream frosting, not the frosting listed. Will become a family favorite!

Rating: 3
Excellent and easy. I omitted the chocolate chips and used another sort of frosting as I was making the cake for my 4-year-old daughter's birthday party and she wanted a special design on top. The cake itself was moist and chocolaty, though I had to cook it about 45 minutes (possibly because I was using a smaller cake pan with higher sides). Very nice basic chocolate cake recipe.

Rating: 4
Great and easy recipe. Accidentally added all cocoa powder in the cake without reserving any for the frosting and it turned out perfectly. Skip the chocolate chips though, no one likes to bite into those. Used all butter. Love that you can frost the cake warm. Used the recommended 3T cocoa for frosting and it was perfect, only because the cake had extra cocoa in it. Will make it again, soon. It was devoured.

Made this for my daughters 8th birthday, cutting the cake into squares and formed a hopscotch pattern. The kids and adults loved the flavor of the cake. I thought the addition of chocolate chips was a bit too much. If I wanted to eat mouthfuls of chocolate chips I could just go to the pantry. Knowing the unhealthiness of trans fats, do people still eat/use margarine? I used butter and had no problems. Adding the teaspoon of cinnamon is a bonus. I did not use this frosting recipe. Good recipe but nothing to write home about. I will try it again but will omit the chips.

This cake was delicious! Easy to make! Just make sure you have all the ingredients as I did not have any powdered suger and had to use canned frosting. yuk! Will make this again and make the frosting with it. I used the margerine and my cake was soupy after 20 minutes just like the other reviewer said after she used butter. Added about another 10-12 minutes to the 20 min stated in the recipe.

My kids love this cake so much, and it's so easy, they make it themselves. I make this recipe with butter instead of margarine. With butter, at least, the cake needs to cook for an hour -- it's still completely liquid at 20 minutes.

This cake is just like the one my aunt makes for our family get-togethers, and it always disappears. I've always wanted to get the recipe from her. The texture is like a cross between a brownie and a cake. My husband and daughter really liked it.

This cake was delicious and very easy to make. A wonderful snack cake. I used butter and mixed it in the KitchenAid. I baked it at 325 in a 13"x9" pyrex dish for 40 minutes. The cake was even better the next day. I have to admit I was underwhelmed by the fosting, needs more choclate.

I made this and followed the directions except used butter. I must say I was rather disappointed. I think I will try it again without the frosting. the frosting really over powers the cake. Not sure about the 10x15" pan...it makes the cake thin...I will give it another go, but as is didn't really like it, now I have a ton of cake

Very kid friendly! Easy to make as well it took me just under 30 minutes to mix it, put it the oven and make the icing. Tastes great and keeps well. I did cook it in a 13x9 pan and used parchment paper and it did just fine. Took a little longer to cook but that's okay!

I have made this cake a couple of times and everyone loves it. It is certainly an easy cake to transport for parties. I took it for a friend's 96th birthday and she declared it to be the best chocolate cake she's ever had! However, she hasn't tried the chocolate walnut layer cake yet! P.S. I've only made it with butter and I have used milk chocolate chips as well as semi-sweet--both are good.

Just a quick note to the cook from Toronto: you can buy cultured buttermilk blend powder for baking and cooking. It keeps in the freezer for about 6 months. That way it's always on hand. I used it and it works great! The cake turned out well. I accidentally blended half of the chocolate chips into the cake before I realized it was a topping, so I topped with the other half. I also added a tablespoon of coffee to the frosting to add depth. I great cake, very versatile!

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I got rave reviews from everyone, the second time it was mixed. I love how easy it is to make and how moist it stays. It is great without the icing too!! I will definitely keep this one on hand for church socials etc.

Thanks, Toronto! I thought pure olive oil in the cake would be weird, but that (with the buttermilk) was absolutely amazing. This is the most moist and delicious chocolate cake I've ever tasted. Outstanding! And soooo easy...

I substituted yogurt for the buttermilk and olive oil for the margarine. It was fantastic. Without question, rich, delicious even without frosting. A great cake.

I have made this cake twice now, once in the recommended pan and once in two 9" springform pans. It has a wonderful soft feathery texture. Both times I have used yogurt (which I always have on hand) mixed with a little milk to thin it, instead of buttermilk (which I never have on hand) and I can't imagine how it could be any better but one day I'll try the buttermilk just to see. The chocolate flavour was not as strong as some other cake recipes I have used so the second time I added a little extra cocoa and reduced the flour slightly. This resulted in a richer flavour. I also used butter (which I always have on hand) instead of margarine (which I NEVER have on hand) (margarine??!!??) But it's a great recipe. Where is it written that something fast, easy and foolproof can't have a fabulous taste too?

I was disappointed with the results of this cake. I made it in a 9x13 pan, maybe that was part of the problem. It was moist toward the middle, but dried on the edges and I didn't like the icing. Instead of nuts, I used M&M's for the topping (for 7 yr. olds bithday party with nut allergies). I added a tsp. of cinnamon and used the SACCO dried buttermilk like previous reviewer. It just didn't grab me, even my son said he hated it! Some of the parents thought it was very good and brownie like, but I was expecting something out of this world based on all the previous reviews.

This is a nice simple recipe that would be great for pot lucks or a nice picnic. Everything is done in the pan, so you don't have to turn anything out onto cooling racks. Just pour the frosting over the warm cake, and its done, until you're ready to serve. Its is very moist, and flovorful, and the ingredients are readily avaiable. I used the SACCO powdered buttermilk, and I think it turned out fine.

This is a fabulous chocolate cake recipe. I made two smaller cakes rather than the one large one. I used butter instead of margarine - also only had 1% milk for the frosting instead of whole milk. Everyone said it was fabulous, even my husband who is not a chocolate cake fan was hopping into it.

I wanted an easy recipe to make for my daughter's girl scout troop meeting so I used this recipe made into individual mini loaf pans. Each girl had her own cake plus my husband got to take mini cakes for dessert in his lunchbox! The cake was very moist, the icing was rich and held up well for several days. It was a big hit with everyone who tried it.

Gosh, I hate to disagree (and I'm not a food snob - I love just about all kinds of food), but this is dull and tasteless. I tried it, thinking it was an improvement on the old Texas Sheet Cake recipe (it was different from others that I found), but it turned out pretty much the same. The chocolate chips helped a little but I think chocolate cake needs real chocolate (not cocoa) and real butter. The only "benefit" is that it makes a big cake that is useful for large gatherings, which could be accomplished by making a double recipe of a yummy cake and baking it in a big pan. I guess I should have thought of that earlier!

Everyone who tried this cake loved it and came back for more. I did add 1 tsp. of cinnamon.

This is a no-fail quick easy recipe. I bake it in various forms. The favorite of my friends and clients is mini-muffin tops or mini-muffin type. They are bite size and excellent in taste.

This has been a family recipe for at least 2 generations. We have always added cinnamon to it and frosted it with a real rich goo of butter, cocoa, powdered sugar & half & half....sort of a thin butter cream. Some people make it on a large sided cookie "sheet" pan, but I prefer to make it in a 9 x 13 and I put chopped pecans on top!! yummmmmm not a low cal item at all!!!!

I suspect everyone in America has either eaten or made this cake most of thier lives. I am no exception. My mother made it for everything and I too now use it in my catering business. We melt the water, margarine, shortning and cocoa and bring to a boil before adding the other ingredients. I'm quite certain that the end results are the same. I had never heard of adding cinnamon until reading the other reviews, but I will surely try it.Oh, and to Val in Denver we call it Texas Sheet Cake instead of chocolate buttermilk cake.

The frosting's flavor is enhanced if the nuts are toasted at 350 degrees for ten minutes before they're chopped and added to the other frosting ingredients. And yes, cinnamon is a must!

I grew up with this cake, too. I can remember visiting relations in West Texas on Colorado Lake - temperatures well over 100F, and no air conditioning. We spent the long weekend in the water, dashing in periodically to grab another piece of the sheet cake my mom had brought with us. Yup, it's gotta have the cinnamon, and having our home-grown pecans chopped not only in the frosting, but in the cake as well made it even better.
