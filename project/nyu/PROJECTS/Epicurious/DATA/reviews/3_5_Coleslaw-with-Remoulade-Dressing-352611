As written this recipe is wayyyy too salty. It was inedible and I threw the whole thing out. I will try it again and either rinse the salt off of the cabbage, or maybe reduce the amount of the creole mustard - it was on the salty side too. Too bad, it was very pretty and I did like the softening effect of the pre-salt.

i liked the recipe and used it as the dressing for a pasta salad - hit with guests. for the pasta, i substituted cucumbers for celery and added matchstick carrots. thanks to other reviewers who suggested spicy brown mustard substitute - worked great!

I didn't pre-salt this either and it was excellent. I live in Thailand, so no creole mustard. I used french's spicy brown, added some horseradish and cayenne pepper and viola, remoulade!!

I made this the first time without pre-salting the cabbage and carrots and it was delicious. The second time, I followed the recipe and pre-salted and drained. Woah, way too much salt. The recipe should say RINSE and drain.

Really.... I had the same question. I made it with fresh parsley, and I think the previous cook should have made the 50-mile trip.

Delicious! The only ingredient I didnt have was the fresh parsley, which it didnt need. I'm sure it would be good included, but it wasn't worth driving 50 miles round trip to get it! Great for a crowd.
