I found it bland. Celery root is just very mellow. Julienne of apple etc did not kick it up (taste-wise) and not everyone liked the raw garnish. I think I'll stick with pumpkin/ butternut or other more flavourful pureed vegetable soups.

I have not made this recipe before. But will be planning on it for thanksgiving looking at the recipe it does look bland. Im going to roast the celery root and leeks and add shallots, maybe one carrot and some garlic which will also be roasted. and probably add a apple in to the soup as well. Ill send a update =)

I love this soup! We didn't have any celery for garnish but otherwise prepared the soup according to the recipe. Served the apple and bacon separately, mostly because I always think it's more fun to do something at the table. Cutting up the celery root finely and using the immersion blender shaved off some preparation time. Definitely will make this again, and would certainly consider serving it as a starter for a dinner party. Good amount for our family of four for a weekday dinner with just bread to accompany.

I like this soup -- it isn't too difficult, and healthful. It was a bit bland, so I added a little lemon juice. I'm tempted to try it with some sour cream instead of half and half to give it a bit more of a kick, too.

Peeling those difficult roots and making a small mess transfering the hot soup to blend it aside may seem like a little too much work for a soup, but believe me, this is no ordinary soup. It is totally worth it. P.S. I replaced the apple with a pear... YUM.

Excellent, served as a first course to 5 and it was plenty. I did need to thin it with additional broth and there was way too much garnish but then maybe it was supposed to sink into the soup??

We thought this soup was amazingly good. My notes: Because of the sizes of the available celery root and leeks I had a generous amount of each. The peeled celery root cubes weighed nearly 1 3/4 lbs and the leeks were all more large than medium. I cooked about 4 oz. of bacon until very, very crisp and strained and used all the fat, about 2 tblsps., and added 1 tblsp of olive oil. I used 2 cups of homemade chicken stock plus 4 cups of water and nearly 2 tsp. of Chicken Better then Bouillon. The resulting soup was very thick. I made it a day ahead. We added a closer to 2/3 of a cup of half and half. We skipped the celery part of the garnish since we don't like celery, but yes, we love celery root. The tart apple and bacon garnish provided a perfect contrast in flavors and textures.This puts any potato leek soup we have ever had to shame. Regarding portion size we had enough for dinner for two with gruyere croutons on the side with enough left over for one lunch.

This soup ACTUALLY only does serve four -- unlike most others that provide more than 1 cup each. I found it a bit thick (easily resolved) and VERY falvorful, as 1 1/2 lb. of celery root is quite alot. The first time I ommitted the 1/2 and 1/2 and actually liked it a bit more, so make a small test of creamy adition before committing the full amount.

This soup is to die for and such an interesting combination. I followed the recipe to a T and it was a cinch.

I found this recipe bland too. If I made it again I would use all chicken stock (instead of a combination of water and stock) and throw in a chopped apple with the celery root. maybe this would add more flavour.

Very nice soup. Not the most flavorful, but still quite good. I subbed whole milk for cream. I would recommend using really good smokey bacon. My significant other actually liked the apple.

More than the sum of its parts is a good way to describe this mild, pleasing soup. I substituted lean ham for the bacon (and instead used the butter to saute the veggies as the recipe recommended) and used a little of the dark green part of the leeks because I like that flavor so much. I was a little doubtful about the green apple in the topping and so I put the ham, celery and apple in separate little bowls for my husband and me to doctor on the table, and I was glad; the apple in the same bite of soup wasn't my cup of tea, but for sure the leftover slices of green apple made a wonderful pairing to munch alongside. I'll be making this solid, satisfying soup again.

This was very easy to make. It proves the saying "the whole exceeds the sum of the parts." Very nice flavor contrasts. It was almost better the next day.
