So incredibly easy. At first I was skeptical that the mushrooms would taste pickled, given the lack of sour ingredients. But they really do have a subtle pickled flavor, followed by a lovely mellow fermented aftertaste. I wish I'd made a double recipe--a pound of mushrooms shrinks up quite a bit.

Great blending of flavors. Very easy prep. A keeper.
