Love this dessert. Pleases adults and children equally. Have made several times and both the pie and the recipe are oft requested. Great for "making ahead".

The pie did not set well, and I did follow the instructions. Even if it were just a problem with the gelatin, I still wouldn't like it. The lime taste was very overpowering. I would've cut the amount of lime juice at least in half.

I have made this pie numerous times and it has always been very well received. I never have any problems with the geletin, and I follow the recipe as written, exept I usually add a couple of drops of green food coloring for presentation. Everytime I have made it I get asked for the recipe.It has just the right tartness without being really bitter and is extremely refreshing during the summer. A keeper.

The first time I made it I had lumps of gelatin (missed a step in the recipe). It was horrible. The simple secret is to carefully follow the recipe. My subsequent efforts were marvelous. Great balance between sweet and tart! Easy to make with an excellent crust.

This is absolutely delicious. I use dry roasted macadamia nuts from Hawaii. Try it. I've made many many times and it's always a rave up!

Yuk. This was not flavorful and somewhat gelatinous. With so many other great recipes on this site, I don't think I'll try this again...though I'm sure it was me who made a great recipe taste bad. There is definitely a fine line between too much gelatin and not enough to help it set...Good luck!

To correct the setting problem, I added an extra teaspoon of the gelatin and chilled the mixture in the freezer for 30 min while the crust was cooling. Then folded in some of the whipped cream, poured the mixture into the crust and chilled in the freezer again for 30 minutes before moving it to the fridge. Brought setting time down to 3 hours and the pie still had a lovely mousse-like texture. I also used bottled key lime juice instead of fresh (you can buy it at Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Williams-Sonoma, and Wild Oats). I was very happy with the results.

This was a stellar pie, made even better by the fact that it was SO easy! I think the crust is really special with the macadamias and coconut, although I think that graham crackers would work just as well as vanilla wafers. The filling was great, and I didn't have any of the issues that previous reviewers did with it seeming too "gelatinous." It was rich and creamy and the perfect sweet-tart balance. I don't think it was the prettiest pie ever; the filling is sort of a translucent white that's a little grayish from the Coco Lopez, but I think that is easily overlooked once you get the whipped cream on top. This would work beautifully as a mini-tart on a dessert table.

Rating: 2
I was surprised after all the excellent reviews that I was not mad about this recipe. The crust was fabulous and have used it again for other pies. The pie was very gelatinous. I would prefer it to be creamier. I LOVE limes but this was even a little overpowering for me. Next time I may try to add more cream & less gelatin. But I guess that would be key lime pie?

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe! Great as a light summer dessert! I would go a little lighter on the lime peel.

I had a love-hate relationship with this recipe! The 35 wafers did not weigh 5 ounces on my scale (but I am from Canada...maybe there is a difference in the size...). I decided to use 35 wafers anyway. I added 1/2 cup of butter instead because it just did not seem to be sticky enough. I found another kind of nut (pekans). The crust was very good anyway. I looked like crazy for the Coco Lopez without success and substituted unsweetened coconut cream (the kind you buy as a block and need to dissolve with warm water). I added a tablespoon of confectioner sugar and 1/2 a spoon of vanilla extract to the filling. The most important insight I had with this recipe: I used an entire pouch of unflavored gelatin with the required 1/2 cup of water (Knox gelatin)and let it set for 6 hours (it needed all this time). The result was very good. I did just add some coconut flakes on top. My guests liked it and so did I. The freshness of the filling is very pleasant with a cup of tea. All in all I had a better result than I expected. I think the filling would be delicious with two or three mashed bananas...next time!

This is absolutely fantastic! Everyone raved! Perfect and so easy to make! I garnished with toasted coconut and lime slices! A huge hit!

I thought this was very good - nice flavors. It was easy to make and got a lot of compliments. I didn't put the whipped cream on top and don't think that it needs it. To San Francisco, cream of coconut should be in your grocery store's alcohol mixers isle (liquor stores probably also sell it) and it can also be found in the Goya foods isle. I made it with Goya's cream of coconut and it was great. Good luck

This is a perfect blend of lime and coconut flavors and I look forward to making this again. I agree with Bill regarding the rating system and I frequently see reviewers commenting that a recipe is 3.5 forks. Maybe a 5 fork system is needed.

Rating: 4
This rating system is too rigid. This pie, as I made it, was better than delicious, but "a dish beyond compare" seems to leave little room for the day I actually find manna from Heaven. Still, as written the recipe is too sweet for this Texan. I substituted fresh key lime juice and homemade Creme Fraiche for the lime juice and yogurt. Perfect texture and piquancy.

Rating: 2
This was very easy. It had a nice bright lime flavour which was a little overpowering in the winter but would be very refreshing in the summer. The pie was a little dense, I might try again folding some whipped cream into the filling before chilling.

01/14/04: Everything was excellent. I chose to cut my lime rounds into halves, they stayed upright. My problem came at serving time when I noticed the lime juices had run and accumulated on the surface. I had to absorb with a paper towel, but my husband, at first glance, thought the pie hadn't set. Any suggestions on how to prevent that next time? 02/05/04: I am adding to my former review. I have now made this two times and it has become one of our favorites! We are not lime fans, but I have stocked up on the coco lopez and macadamias so I can make this whenever the craving strikes. I also upped my rating of 3 to a 4. Just a perfect blend of flavors, not overstated. I have promised to save slices for my neighbors, but each time they weren't quick enough, and the pie was gone...nothing but crumbs! I guess I'll just have to make it again! (yay)

I followed other's advice and used less sugar. I took it to a friend's for dinner and they wouldn't let me take the leftovers home. I made it the same afternoon as the dinner and it set up fine. It was a hit and I will make it often, especially in the summer.

ATTENTION SHOPPERS (and this is coming from the Substitution Queen) DO NOT make this pie with any other coconut milk or cream than Coco Lopez, especially an unsweetened one! If you made it with coconut milk then you didn't actually make it at all. Coco Lopez is super sweet and super creamy and essential. I've made the pie more times than I can count (with various substitutions, believe me) and that's the one essential ingredient. Another tip, give the thing time to set! It's not a last minute concoction... It's a sure-thing, easy-to-make pie that tastes like you slaved! Really, really good (and very, very sweet with an amazing crust.)

Rating: 1
I adored the crust, but the filling was too bitter. I even checked to see if I had left out sugar from the recipe. I'd like to try this crust with the filling from another lime pie, or I would add sugar next time.

Rating: 4
Excellent desert, and I'm not even a key lime pie lover. For simplicity, skipped the whipped cream and used a spoonful on Cool Whip on each slice sprinkled with toasted coconut. I'm not sure how other reviewers substituted coconut milk for cream of coconut. To me that would be like using milk instead of sweetend condensed milk.

I love this pie. I make it often during the summer, especially if I'm going to an outdoor BBQ. You definitely HAVE to use coconut cream...it is much thicker than coconut milk. Coco Lopez coconut cream can be found in the liquor dept of grocery/liquor stores.

My guests ate it, they said it was good, but no one raved about it. I was not at all impressed. I'm not a dessert person to begin with so it has to be really good to make it worth the time and effort. I would not make this again.

I gave this a fair chance but I ended up agreeing with many of the other reviews -- this crust is absolutely amazing, but there are better key lime filling recipes out there. It was definitely a unique change of pace, but I wouldn't make the filling if I wanted to amaze my guests. Of course, I wasn't able to get cream of coconut and had to use coconut milk instead -- requiring adding a lot of additional sugar. I also added 1/2 a teaspoon more of gelatin and it set perfectly. It's an interesting recipe; not a classic keeper, but a pleasant one to try. I'll definitely make the crust again though.

After reading everyone else's review I feel I am being sacrilegious but I thought this pie was way too sweet. I love lime pies and have had great results from the lime pie (Gourmet) on epicurious and Joy of Cooking's key lime pie, but I felt the crust was too overpowering and heavy. I also followed a few reviewers' suggestions which might have been my mistake--or at least, not to my family's particular taste. First, I used really good shortbread cookies instead of vanilla wafers, so maybe that made it too rich. Second, I covered the whole pie with a layer of whipped cream (my kids love it) and it smothered the lime. The one thing I think was fabulous in this pie was the lime part, but it ended up being just some thin little layer between this sweet, heavy crust and the whipped cream. I know I am a crowd of one or two here, so read on for the other reviewers' overwhelming enthusiasm!.

I expected more "coconut" flavor in the filling, and may reduce the amount of lime juice next time. The crust is WONDERFUL! I thought that the strong lime flavor competed with the crust, and that a more mellow filling would be preferable - but my husband disagreed and thought they complemented each other quite well. Side note: go easy on the green food coloring if you decide to add it. I used 2 drops and it turned a horrible color, I will leave the color alone next time.

This is an incredible pie. The tang of lime is the perfect compliment to the sweetness of the coconut. It's a great make-ahead pie. I made the crust 2 days before the picnic and made the filling the day before. For a garnish, I thinly sliced a lime, brushed each slice with beaten egg whites and dipped each in sugar. Then twisted each lime so it stood up and then I piped whipped creme around it.

EVERYONE loved this pie, and it's easy to make. The crust is awesome, and the filling is good, too. I couldn't get my sugar-frosted limes to hold up to the Houston humidity - but no one cared. I'll use this pie again and again when we'll be outdoors in the heat. Refreshing!

Unbelievably good! Easy to make, I followed the directions exactly as the recipe was written and it was wonderful. And great that you make it a day ahead for when you have company. We had guests for dinner and everyone loved it..... even my husband who a) won't eat pie, and b) who really only likes chocolate. He even said he'd eat it again! I did not garnish with the slices of lime, maybe next time I will sprinkle some toasted coconut onto the whipped cream. I'll be making this pie many times again!

Another great pie recipe from Bon Appetit I've added to my summer menu. Crust is exceptional. Filling for our tastes has always been just right. Lime rounds have to be sliced thin and are sometimes hard to stand up for presentation, as in accompanying photo. The cream piping can melt if left out in the warm temperatures too long. Still, it's always a big hit.

I was unsure about making this pie after reading the previous reviews cautioning that it's too sweet. But since we have a tree chock full of limes, I thought I'd improvise a bit and my whole family was pleased with the results. I used store bought graham cracker crust instead of the nut/coconut mixture (saved time too!) I added 1/3 cup shredded coconut to the filling. And topped it off with a ring of fresh raspberries. It was great!

This is a great pie, but I agree with earlier comments...use larger pan, more gelatin, and allow substantially more than four hours to set.

Loved this pie!! Will make it again (& again & again) - especially as a final course for my favorite Tortilla Soup dinner. Was worth every cent the spendy ingredients. After reading previous reviews, I too used shortbread cookies but a bit hesitantly for fear of extra richness but not a problem. Used a bit more lime juice & zest than called for - gave it a nice "bite". I cut the pie in 8 pieces in case it was too sweet or too rich, I also believe we can all use smaller pieces of dessert! try it - it's a winner!

This got very favorable reviews from my friends and was so easy! I do not have a sweet tooth, so I used extra lime juice to compensate for the Coco Lopez. This made for a tart pie. Also-used shortbread cookies rather than the vanilla wafers.

The first bite of this pie was heaven -- sweet, tart and delicious. But by the time I finished my single slice, I had a stomach-ache and my teeth hurt. It's just achingly sweet. I'm not sure how to cut the sugar content without replacing the cream-of-coconut completely, so I won't make this pie again. I'll probably make that crust again, though: it was spectacular!

I made this dish for Father's Day and it turned out wonderful. I have a tip for those who may not have a pastry bag: you can use a ziploc type bag instead. Cut off one corner and then cut a small triangle in the center of it to add texture, it turns out just as pretty.

Very delicious sweet-tart filling with an intriguing coconut flavor, and the texture was lovely. It looked very liquidy when I poured it into the shell but firmed up beautifully. I don't think it needs any more gelatin -- it might make it rubbery. The crust was outstanding ... I could bake that on a flat sheet and eat it like cookies! I found it hard to work with, though -- much more crumbly than other crumb crusts I've made. The next time I'm going to try adding a little more melted butter to it.

A friend of mine brought this pie to my house when we had a "pot luck" dinner. It was fabulous and I asked her for the recipe. She told me that she's had it for years and that everywhere she goes, if it's a "pot luck" dinner she requests to bring dessert so she can bring this pie. She wouldn't give me the recipe, so I came to Epicurious.com and looked it up just by the ingredients I could i.d. and here it is!! It is so yummy- not filling, and a great impressive dessert. We love it, and make it fairly often. It is an "IT" recipe in my book!! And I cook alot!

I used a coconut milk from Thailand and after I poured the filling into the crust I "licked" the bowl. SOUR!! I stirred in as much icing sugar as I could with the filling still in the crust and hoped for the best. My 10 dinner guests loved it and it got loads of praise. Use either a very sweet coconut syrup or adjust for sweetness if using ordinary coconut milk.

I brought this to a summer pot-luck of dedicated foodies and it was a smash success! My only problems: where do you get "dry roasted macadamias"? All I could find were the standard Moana Loa brand of macadamias for snacking, which are salted. I put them in a pan and dry roasted them myself and cut the salt in the recipe. I was also wary of putting the glass pie pan into the hot oven directly from the freezer. Is it really safe to do so? I have had Pyrex explode with sudden changes of heat.

A great, easy summer recipe. In 90 degree heat, I didn't want to bake the crust, so I used a Vanilla Wafer crust from the store, then added the coconut to the yogurt mixture. IT was still a big hit. I can only imagine that the intended crust is even better. I couldn't find low fat plain yogurt, so I used fat-free. It was still a good texture.
