We did most of the veggies in a food processor which I regret somewhat. I think the bell peppers in particular would have been better in 1/2 inch pieces. The texture of the small chop was a distraction. Otherwise the flavor was excellent. I used spicy V8 instead of tomato broth, but afterwards I also added chipotle tabasco for more heat and flavor. It also needed salt and pepper to finish it properly. As written the recipe is 3 forks but with the added tobasco , salt and pepper it is 3.5 forks. We served it with slices of avacado which pushed it all the way into 4 fork territory. We are making another double batch tomorrow and I believe we'll chunk two avocados into 3/4 in. pieces. The recipe is delightful and at around 50 calories per cup (w/out the avocado) it will be a regular feature of our dinner table.

There are some nice underlying flavors in this recipe, but the tomato juice throws the whole thing off. I used canned tomato juice, so maybe that was my problem. The flavor of cheap, canned tomato juice overwhelmed the whole thing and made it taste mediocre and store-bought.

I have been making this recipe since it first came out in '91. Everyone just loves it. It comes out of my recipe box every summer. I have used crab in place of shrimp, I have used V8 in place of tomato juice. Everyway is a big hit...LOVE IT

I had 9 friends for lunch yesterday and made this. It was a hit! I did use Spicy V8 and next time I will use smaller shrimp, the large are a little hard to negotiate in a soup spoon :) Definitely a keeper. Email from a friend: "This was the best gazpacho that I've ever tasted."

Excellent and easy. I added chorizo and shrimp.

I have been making this gazpacho for years. This is one of the few ways my 8-yr-old will eat raw veggies. You could probably replace the shrimp with ham or bacon to make it more "Spanish".

This soup is absolutely wonderful. The taste of each ingredient is brought out when using your fresh local in-season vegetables. I am looking forward to a hot summer to enjoy this refreshing recipe.

I hate to be the odd person out, but I hated this recipe. The tomato juice is kind of gross. But, I have to admit, my husband liked it.

I have tried a lot of gazpacho recipes and this is my favorite. I add a can of white beans to it but otherwise use the recipe as is.

I made this soup for a staff get together. I wore my printer out printing requested copies of the recipe.

Didn't have tomatoe juice, used V8 instead. Made it quite insteresting. After trying it with V8 tomatoe juice might be a little bland
