This is the first oatmeal cookie recipe I've tried for high altitude that actually worked. They didn't flatten to pancakes, which earns 2 forks instantly! I added dark chocolate chips and dried cranberries instead of raisins. They were gone in a flash, everyone loved them.

Not bad, but not great, either. I thought they were a little bland. They were chewy and not too dry, so worth making again, just with improvements next time. Maybe just some more cinnamon or a little nutmeg.

Great basic ORC recipe. I reduced the amount of white sugar to 3/4 c; used Smart Balance sticks instead of regular butter; and, as suggested by a reader in a different ORC recipe, I got the raisins soaking in the eggs and vanilla before starting everything else. Plumped them up nicely.

I didn't like the texture. It was somewhere between a normal oatmeal cookie and a stale cookie. Good flavor, but the texture bothered me too much.

Your basic oatmeal cookie. Good texture. I made it exactly to the recipe this time; would cut the sugar next time. They're too sweet for me. Got the amount of cookies stated in the recipe.

Excellent recipe. I reduced the sugar (3,000 ft.) as follows: brown sugar to 1/4 cup (from 1/2) and white sugar to 1/2 cup (from 3/4 cup) and they were still plenty sweet. Agree that the cookies did not spread out at all to look like the picture and I got just 3 dozen from the recipe. Excellent cookie!

This is a great, old fashioned oatmeal cookie with no fancy distractions.

Cooking from 7,000 feet -- the adjustments worked fine. Made a few ingredient changes to fit my personal taste (whole wheat flour, turbinado instead of white sugar) and got a fantastic cookie -- perfectly crunchy and chewy!

I made one substitution, Smart Balance in lieu of butter, and one addition: a dollop of molasses, which I could NOT detect in the baked cookie. You need a STRONG spoon to mix these by hand, as I did. My cookies did not spread out as much as I expected when baked on my Silpat. Next batch I will space them closer. An excellent, not too sweet, fairly healthy cookie.

I also swapped out the raisins for mini chocolate chips and they turned out fabulous! A great mix with the cinnamon... Most importantly, they weren't a thin, hard, mess of a cookie when they came out of the oven! It's a keeper in my book. :)

Perfect oatmeal raisin cookie recipe. These were just the right ratio of chewy to crunchy when baked for 12 minutes. I followed the recipe almost exactly, and substituted half of the raisins with dark chocolate covered raisins, which was a tasty addition. This will be my go-to recipe for oatmeal raisin cookies from now on.
