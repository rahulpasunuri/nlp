Who cares where it looks like it comes from. There is nothing wrong with enjoying simple food. I thought it was tasty and couldn't stop eating it. I first made it in college and my roommates couldn't get enough.

No, I'm sorry I have to agree with Tennessee on this one. It looks like a recipe from Ladies Home Journal.

I really liked this. It's very easy to make, and it's the perfect comfort food. Nice and cheesy. I'm sure to make this one again.
