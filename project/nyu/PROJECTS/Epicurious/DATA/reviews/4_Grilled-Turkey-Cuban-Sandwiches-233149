This has become a family tradition for leftover turkey. Chili sauce, mint, and lime juices are a nice break from heavy thanksgiving meals.

I decided to take the advice of another reviewer and made these with the pork tenderloin cubano (recipe is on this site). That recipe was fabulous, and substituting in the pork and provolone on this sandwich was outstanding. The mayos are delicious and so simple. This will be a keeper.

Um, in a word, no! This is not a Cuban. Cuban (French if you must) bread, mustard, pickle, sweet ham, roast pork, Swiss cheese; in that order. Some use butter also, but never, ever, mayo!

this is such a great recipe. I first discovered it while still in high school, and with a few modifications, it has since become one of my standard sandwiches. Of course, as my fellow reviewers have pointed out, this is not a TRUE Cuban sandwich, but it is nonetheless delicious. I just add the spicy component (for me, usually a chili garlic sauce) right to the mint mayo to keep things easy, and because I rarely prepare a whole turkey (I'm a college student), I'll just use good deli turkey and/or ham.

This is now the favorite post-Thanksgiving sandwich in our house. The contrasts of mint and hot sauce are simply delicious.

The sandwich is great and everyone loves it. Just takes a little while but worth it!

I have made these sandwiches twice now, and will be making them again for friends on superbowl sunday. Instead of using turkey, however I make the pork tenderloin cubano (from this site) the day before. Also, it MUST have a pickle. A keeper in our house!!

I can see how this sandwich might be delicious, but my fellow Cuban "foodsleuth" is correct, this is no way, no how, Cuban. Please call it what it is...a panini (and defintely try the strawberry jam variety he/she mentioned as well- bien rico! Bien hecho primo/a! =))

I simplified it-made it with only hot sauce-mayo mix, and did not grill it since I hate heated mayo. But it was extremely tasty and simple. A winner. Someday Ill try to follow the whole recipe.

I am Cuban and have never heard of this sandwich. Cubans as a rule like to use spices, but not HOT spices or sauces. A Cuban turkey sandwich would probably have cheese and pickles, but never a hot sauce and mint. Also, we will use ham with roasted pork and a mojo sauce as in the Sandwich Cubano or a Medianoche, but never with turkey. The most famous and popular Cuban turkey sandwich is called an Elena Rus (named after the young deburante that came up with the idea) - thin fresh turkey slices, cream cheese and strawberry jam on toasted bread. Believe it or not, it is delicious

The sandwich was good, but not at all Cuban. For starters, a Cuban sandwich doesn't have anything spicy on it unless you count pickles. But definitely go with way less mayo (Cuban sandwiches don't have that either, btw) and add some pickles. Great tip about the cans to make a panini press at home.

Excellent mayo mixture that I also mixed with chicken. I made small party sandwiches and they were a hit.

The mayonnaise was fantastic but halved the amount as suggested. Used only ham (no turkey) but it was still fantastic. It ended up a litle greasy (do you typically put mayo on a grilled cheese sandwich?), so be prepared. Although it didn't help that I served it with fried plantains. Definitely missed the mojito.

We cut way back on the mayonnaise, doing only the mint mayonnaise, adding hot sauce directly. We did it on a panini grill which worked great. We plan to do this again next time we have turkey
