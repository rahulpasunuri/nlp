Delish! I also doubled the topping and used 2/3 cup of oats. Also added the juice of one lemon to the apples as well as a half tsp of cinnamon. This dish was awesome!

What do you do when someone hands you a grocery bag filled with apples? Especially a bag of Arkansas Blacks. Pies and sauce come imediately to mind, but this crisp has to be included in the list. So easy. I used fresh cranberries rather than dried, added about 1/3 cup sugar to the apples, as well as the juice and zest of 1 lemon, and a generous 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. This eliminated having to cook the dried berries. I too doubled the topping recipe, as one reviewer said, "That's the best part." As a close friend said, "Oh! That's a keeper!"

Have been making this recipe for a few years now with just a couple of additions. I use two Granny Smith along with about 8 McIntosh. I double the topping as most reviewers have said. I also add 2/3 -1 cup chopped and toasted pistachios to the topping along with some grated ginger. Guess I stole that idea from another recipe. Great fall dessert.

wow, this was good! I used 5 different kinds of apples, which I love to do, gives a really nice depth of flavour. Didn't have cinnamon sticks, so used powdered cinnamon in the water. Am making this again right now!!

I have made this on many occassions and it always comes out good when you follow the suggestions here. I do always double the crust - thats the best part! And I use granny smith apples. Making it again tomorrow!

YUM. but definitely double the topping. this recipe has been used for various holiday parties, and always this dish is gone first!

I too, doubled the topping amount and added in an equal amount of oatmeal (can't have apple crisp without oatmeal in my book). Also tossed in a little lemon juice and cinnamon with the apples. Success!

I forgot to include the brown sugar with the rest of the dried ingredients and didn't remember until the dish had already baked for 20 minutes. So I sprinkled it on top of the crisp and baked it for another 5 minutes. I think I will do it that way next time as well. It caused the crisp to brown nicely and it was actually "crisp" on top the way I like it. I also added cinnamon and cloves to the dried ingredients as well as chopped walnuts. I also doubled the dry ingredients. And I used Granny Smith apples. It was excellent. I think I will make this a Christmas dish as well.

FABULOUS! I can't stop eating it and the family loves it. I also doubled the topping as recommended but stayed with 3/4 cup flour and used 3/4 oats on the dbl.

I thought this was good, but I tinkered with the filling a bit...tossed the fruit with a little brown sugar, cinnamon, ground ginger, and a pinch of cloves. Very good!

i followed this recipe to a tee, except i used gala apples and 1/2 a stick of butter; i didn't realize that was all i had. it was DELICIOUS and it got rave reviews! the topping was plenty. doubling it would have been too much. This is definitely going into my 'go to' recipe box.

Rating: 3
I followed the directions exactly but the topping did not turn golden so I put it under the broiler for a few minutes resulting in a nicely browned and crisped topping. Overall it is a delicious combination of flavors, but clearly it's meant to be eaten at once as the leftovers became mushy after just one day.

This is one of the easier crisp/crumble recipes, a great way to use up the spoils of fall apple picking. It was very well received at home. I used orange-flavored dried cranberries (Trader Joe's) and star anise instead of cinnamon. Also a different variety of crisp apple. Result was really really yummy.

Used 3 lb. granny smith apples and added 3 macintosh apples. Doubled topping, but substituted oatmeal for 1/3 cup of the flour and used 1/3 cup less brown sugar. Used dried cherries instead of cranberries. Excellent!

This tastes amazing! I didn't have a cinnamon stick so I took the advice of another reviewer and used a cinnamon apple tea bag with the cranberries. I also doubled the topping. Highly recommended.

Was craving apple crisp and this recipe really hit the spot. Doubled the topping like other reviewers and added an equal amount of oats to the flour. Also added cinnamon to the apples. Next time i will try tossing the apples with lemon for a little more tartness and maybe add some chopped walnuts to the topping.

All of the previous posts have it right! This is an outstanding base recipe. Based on many other comments, I changed a multitude of things... 1/2 cup real apple cider and 1/2 cup water to rehydrate the cranberries. I didn't have a cinnamon stick...so I sprinkled a bit of cinnamon over them, along with some allspice. I doubled the topping but used 2/3 c flour and 2/3 cup oats..then followed others' lead and did some lemon juice and cinnamon over granny smith apples v. mcintosh. This is the most delicious crisp I've ever had! Perfect balance of sweet and tart ~ made it at Thanksgiving and will now make it at Christmas : )!!

Delicious! I also made a few minor adjustments: First off, I didn't peel the apples (Granny Smith) and it saved a lot of time and added a subtle bite - so good. I tossed the sliced apples in a tiny bit of lemon juice (maybe 1 tsp?) and dusted the apples with cinnamon and then tossed to coat evenly. I also doubled the topping, and so glad I did, and added 1/3 cup of rolled oats. Mixed the topping in a food processor for ease. Also, this will probably sound crazy to some people, but after I had the whole thing ready to go, I sprinkled the tiniest little bit of sea salt (1/4 tsp maybe) over the topping to give it that sweet/savory deliciousness - and boy did it work! Fantastic contrast yet so complimenting! Will definitely make again!

I made this for Thanksgiving. It was delicious! I did used the juice of 1 lemon to toss the apples in and used 1 1/2 times the amount of topping. Otherwise made the recipe as it is. Really good! Will make again!

This was excellent, also doubled the topping, but instead of doubeling the flour, I added mueslie mix to it. I also added cinnamon, clove, ginger and cardamon to the topping. I made a yogurt honey sauce with it and served it instead of ice cream. This is a keeper!!!!!!!

I followed a few ideas from previous posts and tossed the apples with lemon juice and some ground cinnamon before putting them in the baking dish. also, i used 1/2 whole wheat flour. i made extra topping based on others' suggestions, but found it unnecessary. next time i might try some rolled oats for extra crunch. it was delicious! not too sweet, and really flavorful.

believe the hype, people. That's all I have to say. This is a very good crisp. I made 1.5x the topping, using 1/2c whole wheat flour, 1/2c all purpose flour. Really easy, really delicious.

Very good, extremely versatile. I used a cinnamon spice black tea bag to infuse and rehydrate the dried mixed berries I used. I also doubled the topping and subbed whole wheat flour and rolled oats. The apples I had were honey crisp and fuji.

Very Good! The infusion of the cinnamon stick with the cranberries before adding them to the apples makes for a very tasty treat. Using different apples or combining different types of apples makes for different tastes. You can also use peaches instead of apples when in season! YUM!

Really really good. I used GF flour and dairy free butter and you couldn't tell at all! I doubled the topping as others suggested and it was really good! Not sure the cranberries did anything for it, but maybe will try raisins with the cinnamon sticks next time.

I used a combination of apples and pears because that is what I had on hand. I also took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the topping mix. I did add cinnamon to the topping mix also. It was easy and delicious.

Delicious. Followed previous advice by adding lemon and extra spices to apples. Subsitutions: Craisins for dried cranberries and Splenda for sugar for my diabetic guests. Would reduce the sweetener next time due to the sweetness of the Craisins.

Fabulous! I doubled the topping ingredients and added a little cinnamon and used a combination of MacIntosh and Granny Smith apples. I wasn't entirely convinced when I removed the crisp from the oven as the topping appeared a little more grainy than other crisps that I have made, BUT once I tried it I was converted and couldn't stop 'testing' it! All my guests loved it and one went so far as to say it was the best crisp he had ever eaten.

I substituted cranberries with dried cherries and blueberries - 1/2 cup each. Fantastic! This is a definite repeat.

This was absolutely delicious. We wanted something "fall" to serve to our dinner guests last night. We followed the advice of reviewers and doubled the topping...excellent suggestion. Used craisins for the cranberries and also sprinkled extra cinnamon on the apples. We used gala apples. Served it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yummy. We actually just had some leftovers and are talking about serving this as one of our Thanksgiving desserts. Make this...you won't be disappointed.

Made this for a family birthday party, and everyone wanted the recipe. Had used previous reviewers suggestions regarding tossing apples with lemon juice, cinnamon & nutmeg, and definitely doubled the topping, using oats & walnuts along with the other ingredients to make it bulkier. My grandmother (who is a fantastic cook) swore it was the best crisp she'd ever tasted.

Needs a double batch of topping, but otherwise a great dish!

I just made this for Thanksgiving and the dish was a hit! I'd like to echo some sentiments and say that you should double the topping as it is not enough to cover the apples. I used McIntosh apples and also experienced mushiness, so I'd advise slicing the apples thick. Also, I only added half of the sugar required since I used Craisins. Next time I make this, I'd add only 1/2 a cup of the cranberries. All in all, this is tasty and rather easy to make.

I'm a little disappointed: I used Granny Smiths and cut them about 1/4+ inch thick, but apples turned pretty mushy. Tastes good, but too soft. Next time I'll cut them thicker.

Rating: 4
So incredibly easy and enjoyed by all. I used fewer apples since I like things a little tarter. It was very good and also the texture was great with less apple in the apple to cranberry ratio. Next time I will use more cinnamon and might opt for a tarter apple than McIntosh (actually I used JonaMac).

I changed a few things that I think made it better. I used Michigan Empire apples that have a bit of a tart taste and again since I live in Michigan I used dried cherries instead of cranberries. I also used whole wheat flour, cut the brown sugar a little and added pecan bits on the top. I served it with a drizzle of honey. Very yummy!

Rating: 4
This was great and so easy (especially when someone else did the peeling and slicing); I used a mixture of apples from an apple picking trip -- so i don't know what kind we used. I used multiple suggestions in the reviews:lemon juice to retard browning,adding cinnamon and nutmeg to the apples; I used the cuisinart to mix the topping ingredient which was super easy. We used 'craisins'. Great recipe! Yummy and easy!My kids loved it and so did the grownups.

I didn't use cranberries because I didn't have any on hand but it was still good. I put cinnamon on the apples instead. However, I do wish I had doubled the topping to get more crisp. Also, I used Gala apples instead and they were yummy.

Great recipe! I brought this to a holiday party and it got raves. Except for the time it takes to peel and core the apples, it was very fast and easy. A couple of recommendations to make it even better -- squeeze some fresh lemon juice (just enough to make damp) on the apple pieces and sprinkle cinnamon and nutmeg on them before putting in the dish. Also, make double the topping recipe. I did and am glad since without it I wouldn't have been able to completely cover the dish. That's everyone's favorite part anyway. Also, I used granny smith apples instead of mcintosh and they were great.

This made a great weeknight dessert. I used craisins and wish I'd reduced the sugar to accomodate their sweetness, but hubby thought it was tart enough without changing. I plan to remake, also, without the topping--the cranberries and apples (gala) were divine without it.

This is a wonderful apple crisp recipe. The cranberries really add a nice tart flavor. I cheated and microwaved them along with the cinnamon stick, it worked very well. The topping was crisp and I actually preferred it to the more common oatmeal version.

Great dish for the Jewish New Year. However, the amount of topping is really not enough for a 13X9 dish. Double it so that everyone gets a good portion of the crunchy stuff!

Never being the one to leave good enough alone, I substituted the water for 1C apple juice and simmeredthe crans with two sticks of cin and a dash of ground cloves. 5 star. Try it and see. The smell is out of this word.ps: come to think of it, a dash of lemon and switch from apple juice to cran apple next time.

Quite tasty and pretty as well. And easy. I used Granny Smith apples, and needed to cook it longer, but it was still sweet and juicy enough.
