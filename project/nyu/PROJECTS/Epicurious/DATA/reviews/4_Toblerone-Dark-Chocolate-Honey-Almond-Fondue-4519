This was phenomenal! My store didn't have dark Toblerone, so I used 1 bar of the milk chocolate Toblerone and 1-4 oz bar of 60% Ghiradelli. Other than that, made exactly as written. Rave reviews from my friends.

Best fondue recipe ever. I had been trying to make a decent chocolate fondue for years but they always get too thick and cakey. This one is perfect -- although I used one milk chocolate and one dark chocolate Girardelli bar (couldn't find Toblerone). Delish. I've made it twice and will be making it again this weekend (and whenever I need a quick dessert that makes guests or my family feel pampered.)

Thought this was an excellent fondue and very easy to make! We made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Used bittersweet Bakers chocolate - will try the yummy Toblerone next time :)

Delicious chocolate fondue. Other chocolate fondues I've made tend to separate or harden, but this one stayed a perfect consistency. Beautiful flavors, too. I used 1/2 tablespoon of kirsch and 1/2 tablespoon of amaretto and omitted the almond extract.

I made this for New Year's Eve and substituted Chambord for a chocolate raspberry flavor! Fabulous!

People beg me to make this recipe again. It is wonderful. I also use the 1/2 dark and 1/2 milk Toblerone and I also omit the kirsch.

We have made this for years. I use half dark and half milk chocolate. Even bought individual fondue pots for dinner parties. Pair with some homemade marshmallows and fruit, and you will be a dessert hero!

Easy and elegant desert. My husband is not a fan of bittersweet chocolate so I added some milk chocolate to the recipe. The store was out of Toblerone so I used Droste Chocolate Pastilles in bittersweek and milk. I doubled the recipe for a party of 6 and had very little left over. My girlfriend said it was the best chocolate fondue that she ever had.

What a wonderful recipe! It took no time at all, and the texture was beautifully smooth. Next time I'll try it with half milk and half semisweet chocolate. I used Ghiradelli's instead of Toblerone.

This is an excellent fondue recipe! We left out the kirsch because we didn't have any, and the kids and adults all loved it! We used 1/2 dark chocolate and 1/2 milk chocolate Toblerone bars. A double batch was barely enough for 9 people!

I made this for Valentine's dinner and my husband adored it. I used one toblerone bar and semi-sweet baker's chocolate. I served it with fresh strawberries, bananas and pears. I didn't have the cherry brandy on hand, so I omitted that from the recipe. It was still amazing for my first fondue ever...won't be my last, that's for sure!

I've made this recipe on several occasions and it's a big hit everytime! Especially fun for kids! I couldn't find dark chocolate so I used milk chocolate and it turned out great. Works well served with macaroons and Iniskillin Ice Wine!

This was very delicious! I served it with brownie bites (that I made from scratch), bananas, strawberries, marshmallows, and biscotti, I did have to double, then triple the recipe to make enough for about 30-40 people, but I would definitely recommend this recipe!

I served this at my company Holiday Party and it was a big hit. There wasn't a single dipping item that didn't taste good with this fondue (pound cake, strawberries, dried apricots, gingerbread cookies...). I think that the kirsch gives it a special kick. It was a great fondue for non-die-hard chocolate lovers.

PHE-NOM-EN-AL! We made it two times in three days. It was what you want when you think choclate. You can find Toblerone year round at Cost Plus World Market. Other than that, they are hard to find.

I made this for my husband in the middle of the year. I've realized you CANNOT find Toblerone outside of the holidays easily, but I substituted Bakers semi-sweet chocolate. YUM!!! Definitely making this again.

Really decadent and delicious. I used all dark chocolate Toblerone. Next time I might try it with half milk, as my husband prefers it. We dipped marshmallows, pumpernickel bread, baby bananas and cherries. The bread reminded me of one of my German mother's favorite treats; Nutella on dense, dark German nut bread. The cherries were my favorite.

Incredibly easy and yummy! Just make sure your guests enjoy nuts. Also, if using a "normal" sized fondue pot, this recipe works great doubled.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was a nice Valentine's treat. Definitely not too sweet if you use the dark chocolate.

Excellent, even though I couldn't find the Dark Toblerone. I had to make a few substitutions but this recipe was a nice starting point.

Not being a fantastic cook I had to consult Epicurious for a receipe. This recipe was fantastic one to have when the husbands are not around it was even better than the actual tolberone itself. Fantastic will try it again real soon.

this is easy and quick; it took all of 20 minutes, the longest part is chopping toblerone. i've never cooked with chocolate before and it was my first time to do fondue - easy and not too delicate! I added butter at the end for the shine (it pays to watch food network for tips!. aside from fruits, we dipped angel food cake, pound cake, marshmallows and madelines! will definitely make it again....

I am surprised that people do not love this recipe. We made it and had great success! It was so creamy and sweet. I liked it best with bananas.

Every body threw up. Not impressed in the least. Will never try one of you recipes that ONLY rates 83% - rather low. In fact rather put off fondues forever.

I used only Toblerone milk chocolate for this and wished that I had cut back on the honey by at least half. It was wonderful anyway (although very sweet). The texture was great. Also, I used regular brandy instead of the kirsch and that was just fine as well. In addition to the orange sections, pears, strawberries, and bananas, I also sliced up a Macintosh apple and a Granny Smith one as well. I also cut one inch cubes of pound cake for dipping which was great!

I made this for a larger holiday party so I doubled the recipe, using half toblerone and half semi-sweet chocolate and it was a great success. The other reviewers have made me curious about mixing the milk and dark toblerone bars - I'll have to try that next time!

This is a fabulous, easy fondue. Everyone who has tried it loves it. I do however always mix toblerone dark and toblerone milk chocolate when making it. It's become a fvaorite for parties.

I've had two very different experiences with this recipe. The first time I made this, the fondue maintained a soft, well-blended consistency (I think I may have used the regular milk chocolate Toblerone in the yellow box). The second time I made it, it was lumpy, goopy and didn't adhere to any of the fruit or other items used for dipping. I definitely used the dark chocolate version for my second attempt.

This fondue is scrumptious! We had it for breakfast Christmas morning with apples, pears, oranges, and cherries. It's especially good with cherries. We also dunked our waffles in it. Mmmm....

Outstanding! This recipe was fantastic and was definitely a favourite at our fondue party!
