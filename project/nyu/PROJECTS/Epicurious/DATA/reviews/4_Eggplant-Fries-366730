Not a real review just a note to help. Zatar can refer to thyme or to a seasoning mix that will vary from cook to cook. In my Lebanese kitchen is prepared with thyme, oregano, sesame seeds, sumac and salt

I was not enthralled with this. I soaked the eggplant, upped the spices, left out the dipping sauce but used the lemon juice/salt combo. Although they were crispy/light/etc., they were not flavorful (maybe better soaked in broth?), and quite a bit of work so that I could not sit with my company. I also have frying oil to dispose of. Egh.

We don't fry much, but these were worth the effort--light, crispy, a very fun change from potato fries. However, the seasoning was pretty subtle--next time I will ramp the spice up a bit

Awesome!

I've made this twice now and both times, the fries disappeared-fast. I did adjust the quantity of za'tar down a little since I wasn't sure how I -and my family-would like it, since it's a rather strong flavor. But the eggplant was still delicious. I especially like the advice to soak in water for several hours since eggplant is like a sponge with oil. No more soggy, greasy fried eggplant! I will definitley be making this again-and again!

The fries--excellent. The sauce--not so excellent. Took the fries to a neighborhood wine/appetizer party and the fries disappeared. Used TJs curry powder instead of za-atar, which is not in stock in this small town. The dipping sauce tasted off. Maybe our garden oregano was past it's prime. Served a mayo/curry sauce instead.

I was skeptical, but no longer. Followed the recipe exactly, except the temperature of the oil was closer to 350 rather than 325. Perfect crispness, flavor, texture. The lemon juice and salt at the end is great; you have to try it. Didn't even need the dipping sauce. Will never make french fried potatoes again. And here's the kicker: neither I nor my husband even LIKED eggplant until now. We both LOVED this.

This recipe is a surprise. I soaked the eggplant for hours as directed and the result was crispy, luscious, non-greasy fries. Really delicious.

I rarely deep fry (note to self: heating oil takes much longer than you think it will), but these looked so good I did the foolhardy thing and unleashed them untested on an outdoor dinner party. I couldn't get them on the table fast enough! It's truly remarkable how light they emerged from the oil. And the first bite, a delightful, shattering crispness followed by warm creaminess. I'm not a spice wizard by any means, but I can imagine dabbling with a variety of seasonings here and seldom hitting a sour note. Well worth the effort.

These were wonderful! Light and delicious.

Beautiful! They turned out crispy on the outside and tender inside. I added curry powder to the rice flour instead of za'atar and the flavor was delicious. Couldn't make them fast enough!
