Delicious and very forgiving recipe. I substituted based on what I had at hand -- scallions instead of shallots, the juice and grated zest of 1/2 orange rather than frozen concentrate and cider vinegar for the rice vinegar. Took longer than 6 minutes to reduce but came out great! Served over tuna that I marinated for 15 minutes in soy sauce, peppered and pan seared.

Overall, I'm happy with the recipe. I served it over seared ahi and wasabi mashed potatoes. However, I'll definitely reduce the amount of orange juice next try as it made the sauce a bit too tart for my taste.

I've made this sauce a few times now to use with fish. When I've not had orange juice concentrate I just use a bit of fresh orange which is just as nice!

A delicious sauce. It smelled a bit strange at first but was very tasty.

I respectfully disagree w/ the cook from San Francisco. This sauce is amazing, not too sweet and is perfect as is. I do agree, however, that it takes more than 6 minutes to reduce the sauce, but it still tastes great. Others have noted it's saltiness, which is most likely due to buying the wrong kind of miso. There are several varieties and plenty of differences between brands. Generally, the darker the miso, the saltier and stronger-flavored it is. Opt for a lighter yellow (but not a sweet white "shiro" miso), and you shouldn't run into the problem of too much saltiness. I served this sauce w/ pan seared tuna, salmon, and even panko-crusted pan-seated firm tofu for vegetarians like myself. It's fantastic!

The flavor of the orange juice concentrate takes over making too sweet and uninteresting. The sauce also needs to cook for more than six minutes to reduce fully.

Good, but it needed some help. The basic recipe was too salty and didn't have enough spice or complexity. I incorporated a little Sriracha sauce (Thai chili sauce), wasabi paste , and a pinch of sugar into this recipe to make it really great. After cooling the mixture, I pureed it in a blender and set the flash-grilled ahi atop a plated pool of the sauce. A little sauce on top and it was Oh So Good! Sesame soba noodles are a nice accompaniment.

I used less broth with some dry sherry, fresh squeezed OJ and some snipped chives at the end instead of cilantro. Pretty darn good.

My favorite recipe so far from this site. It's even good with canned tuna, served over rice.

I loved this. I made it and used it on tuna steaks (that I then grilled on the George Forman Grill - 90 seconds - a must have!!). I also added the miso too early. It didn't make a difference. I also served quinoa with dinner and used it on the grain. That was very yummy!

This sauce, intended for the Pan-Seared Tuna on this site, would also be very tasty with salmon. It might overpower a bland fish, however. I goofed when I made it, adding in the miso to the other ingredients instead of at the end, but it all turned out just fine.

Easy and delicious and quick. I made it with a small can of pinapple juice rather than the frozen oj & reduced the broth to 1/4 cup. Wonderful on oven-steamed salmon and seared scallops.

Yummy and simple. I made it with green onions, real OJ, and lots of ginger. Served it over chow mein noodles, which was good, but next time I'd do it with fish or meat as recommended, as the noodles sort of thinned out the flavor too much.

Terrific sauce. Easy yet complex. As per suggestions, I served it on pan-seared tuna steaks and rice. Next time, I'll cook in more shallots and some green onions, throw in a little chopped cucumber, and serve it in fish tacos.
