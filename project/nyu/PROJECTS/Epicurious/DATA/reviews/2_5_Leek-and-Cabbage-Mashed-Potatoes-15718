As a variation on colcannon the leeks added a nice touch..but I did not cook the cabbage with the potatoes, rather I steamed it seperately and added it to the pottoes after mashing. Nicer texture!

No one liked this dish, though we love cabbage as well as mashed potatoes. The cabbage and leeks didn't add anything to the flavor and actually seemed to detract from the usually delicious Yukon golds. Not worth the trouble.

These pototatoes were out of this world! My family loved them! I did add some cheddar cheese the second time I made them and that worked out great too!

I liked the concept of this recipe but I thought there should be more of the potato because it was a bit watery. My husband thought there were too many leeks. I took the leftovers and put them in the blender with more chicken broth. And added some leftover chopped chicken, chopped cooked brussels sprouts, chopped tomato, and a little grated cheddar cheese for a delicious soupl
