I made this without the coconut milk and tossed in the chili sauce before serving - excellent dish.

I'm not sure why this didn't work for me. It was OK, but way too much work for an OK dish.

A truly amazing and flavourful sauce. The preparation time was definitely longer than I'd expected, but completely worth it. Followed the recipe as presented.

The sauce was excellent. I used the left over sauce and veggies mixed with chicken broth to make soup the next day.
