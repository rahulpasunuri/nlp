Delicious! I fried the sage first in the 1/3c. olive oil and then I used the same oil to blend with the garlic. Depending on what else you are serving 2 1/2 lbs of sweet potatoes barely feeds 5.

Really excellent! (BTW, "sweet potatoes" are sold as "yams" in the US. Search "sweet potato" on epi and click the "articles and guides" tab for an explanation.) I served these with Herb-roasted pork, beet-red onion-cranberry relish, a green salad, and a bowl of radishes with their baby leaves. Mmm-m-m.

This is the best sweet potato recipe I've ever had. We didn't add sage, but instead added extra garlic and drizzled maple syrup over the rounds - they taste more like a dessert than a side. We have already made this several times.

Good, but nothing special. However it looks quite nice. Followed recipe exactly.

Oh my mother of all that is sweet and holy, this was beyond amazing, even though - or maybe because?  I had to sub in ground sage, which I just added to the oil mixture, for sage leaves. I don't think I've ever enjoyed cooked sweet potatoes more.

Followed the exact directions - the sweet potatoes were great. Not sure how much the fried sage leaves added, but my guest had fun sprinkling them on top. Will definitely make again.

I made this without the sage, and without a food processor. I simply chopped the garlic and it was still so good, even cold. I actually really enjoyed eating it along side a Tuscan tuna salad. Delicious combo.

Had this instead of mashed sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving. This was delicious and everyone loved it. There were no leftovers. Don't need to just wait for holidays to make it.

perfect Thanksgiving appetizer. this was quick and simple--enjoyable to make. i was worried the garlic would be overpowering in flavor (i am not a big garlic person) but it ended up being lighter and delicious. The platter i made was devoured quickly and people who said "just one more" had more than that :-)

Sublime! Easy and delicious. The sage is a very nice touch.

P.S. anyone who is worried about the 'cost' of 'sage' I would like to tell them that it can be easily grown in a place that gets afternoon sun and the sage plant will probably come back the following year all by itself without replanting! I grew it in a huge plastic decorative pot near my front door and was delighted to see that it regrew again the following spring!! So you can try growing some and you might be pleasantly surprised when it comes back! {I don't know if its due to the unusually mild winters we've had the past few years here in Jersey or what, but I'm happy it's comming up on its own without re planting!}

Off the subject a bit - is it me or does that 'Westin' advertisment to the right of the screen that keeps popping out every time the mouse is anywhere near it drive you crazy ?!!! Back to the recipe..... I was aprehensive at first because when I mixed the olive oil/garlic mixture with the sweetpotatos it smelled 'off'. I was also unsure about the fried sage. And these feelings are comming from a very adventurous eater {me}. But once the potatos were baked and the sage was on top I was pleasantly surprised! The taste was sweet yet savory as another reviewer had said, & my husband immediatly liked them too! The only change I made was that I cut the potatoes into small 'fries' instead of discs. Some of the smaller peices 'crisped' around the edjes. This recipe is a great healthy way to serve sweet potatos in my opinion. The sage added an additional flavor 'note' to the dish which was very nice and I wouldn't leave it out. A keeper in my book.

Great healthy alternative to roasted sweet potatos with butter and salt.

Not as good as I expected based on prior reviews. The sage wasn't worth the effort, mess or cost. The sweet potato rounds were tasty, but not a wow recipe.

I didn't have sage, but this still was a great way to eat sweet potatoes (instead of the usual baking). My blender couldn't get the cloves in the bottom so I just chopped the garlic and tossed the rounds in the garlic and oil. Delicious crust on the potatoes. Great!

Made this with no changes to recipe. Had it with our leftover night from Christmas ham dinner. Whole family loved it! Will definitely make again. Very easy, and delicious.

I had these at Thanksgiving and they were wonderful. I don't ordinarily eat sweet potatoes and I could not get enough!

This dish is so simple and yet so incredibly delicious! I took the advice of one of the reviewers and used the sage oil to toss the sweet potatoes in. So I made the recipe backwards. I fried the sage first and then blended the garlic with the left over oil. Then toss, then bake. So easy! It was the highlight of my dinner party.

Simple. Different. Deelish!

I was looking for a non-sweet sweet potato dish and this was fabulous. I did make several changes -- used about four shallots in the oil, roasted on cookie sheet - also sprinkled with some red wine vinegar to add some tang. I then layered in a casserole with dried sage -- really was a hit!

This recipe is always a bit hit. It is so easy to make and a crowd pleaser. It uses only 4 ingredients and is a nice savory option for sweet potatoes. It is also vegetarian friendly. Try it - you won't be sorry!

Me and my guests loved this recipe but I wish it was more sagey. Next time, I will fry the sage first and use the leftover cooking oil as the oil base for the garlic oil - hoping to transfer some of the flavour to the potatoes while they marinate.

These were SO easy and SO delicious. These will absolutely be a staple in my mental recipe list. With the fried sage, they'll stop sizzling in the oil pretty quickly, but don't think it's a mistake - that's just what happens when all the moisture is sucked out. Also, for those worried about it being too sagey, actually frying them takes out some of the strength so they're just really a pleasant accompaniment. I highly recommend this recipe!

These were super easy and delicious. I only have an immersion blender, which was kind of tricky, but i managed it by adding a little extra oil and putting it in a cup (for more depth). I couldn't find sage leaves anywhere, so i just chopped up a combination of fresh basil, parsley, dill and cilantro that i had at home and sprinkled over just before serving. It was so lovely. I can say that of all the herbs, the parsley complimented the best. seriously fantastic, and even better on day two!

Excellent savory twist on sweet potatoes, which we usually serve augmenting their sweetness!

Amazing, simple, loved by all. I felt like it needed a tad of salt and some fresh parm. cheese finely grated. The sage was a perfect complimenting flavor. Take out of oil just before you think it's done and it will be done right!

Easy and delicious. I used the oil I flash fried the sage in when blending the garlic and oil mixture.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them! My fiance fried the sage leaves and the oil must have been too hot, because they were burnt to a crisp even though he followed the time recommendation. Instead we used dried sage and sprinkled it in the oil mixture. I will make this again and again because it is so fantastic!

Agreed, this is a great recipe, especially for such a simple one. We made it for Thanksgiving and my guests devoured it, I got almost nothing, so I made it again for Christmas using both sweet potatoes (the white ones) and yams (orange ones) and I still like the sweet potatoes better. The yams got a little mushy, but my husband liked them. Test them after 20 minutes if you like them a little al dente. Very easy to get ready in advance and then pop in the oven. Next time, I might try fried basil or parsley instead of sage, just to change it, but the sage was great (careful not to burn the leaves in the oil).

My boyfriend made these for Thanksgiving. Phenomenal, especially for such a simple dish. It was one of my favorite parts of the meal. Probably biased, as I love anything with fried sage, but these really were great. We used local organically grown sweet potatoes from our CSA and the farmers market, which could have only helped. (As an aside, my boyfriend isn't a recipe follower, so he just mixed chopped garlic with evoo and pressed it on the potato rounds and I'm sure he used a lot more garlic).

This Thanksgiving I made this recipe word for word. I simply LOVED it! Family members that didin't like sweet potato's got a second helping! The fried sage was easy, deliciouse, and very fun too. I recomend this dish for anyone! Even the kids enjoyed it! My old recipe invalved tons of sugar. This recipe is helthier AND just as sweet!

This was excellent! The garlic oil puree was incredible and really made for a delicious sweet potato. We needed more roasting time for the sweet potato than indicated. The sage leaves were a great and unusual garnish, loved it.

Made this for Thanksgiving as an alternative to the traditional too-sweet sweet potatoes. Family loved it. Fried sage was pretty as a garnish, but the sage flavor really didn't come through as much as we had hoped. Am thinking about using the sage frying oil to blend with the garlic for a marinade next time. Any other ideas?

Easy and the fried sage added an elegant touch. I may try lightly salting the sage next time.

Absolutely fantastic. I made this for Thanksgiving this year and I plan to make it every year from now on! Even my husband, who usually isn't wild about sweet potatoes, liked this preparation.

I did not make the fried sage but made just the roasted sweet potatos. They were delicious and I will definitely make them again. Very quick and easy to do.
