This recipe was ok. I felt that the flavors were not powerful enough and the pie crust was an unfortunate addition - I think using a gram cracker or cookie crust would have matched better. The whipped cream was unnecessary and definitely does not need much sugar if you use it. I probably won't make this again, but if I do, I'll add more chips to the custard mix and use a different variety crust.

I made my own pie crust and followed the instructions exactly and it was delicious. Thumbs up from my entire family. Very rich, but for those who love peanut butter and chocolate, a perfect treat. I don't recommend adding the powdered sugar to the whipping cream. It made it a funny texture. The whipping cream is plenty sweet on its own without it.

Didn't notice that the recipe called for PB chips until I was well into making the custard. Didn't have any so used one cup of peanut butter instead and it was delicious. the chocolate mixture was so firm, I put it on the bottom and the peanut butter mix on top. Delicious.

Advice for new cooks like me: (1) Use a graham cracker crust instead of a dough crust, and (2) do NOT skimp on saucepan size; the mixture's volume triples (or more) in the first boiling step.

I make this easy pie over and over for catering jobs. I pile the whipped cream higher than the recipe calls for and make a web design on the top with Hershey's Syrup. After I put a cherry on top, I name it "Diner Pie"! Simply scrumptious!

I liked it.It wasnt as good as the restaurants we had visited but it still passed the test.The top however was not as thick as the bottom.I think i will use less custard for the peanut butter chips so it would match the thickness of the chocolate filling.

My husband and best friend LOVED this recipe! I did as well, but I don't have as big of a sweet tooth as they, so they are the better judges. I'm doing it again for Christimas dinner.

I made this recipe for a pie competition and I won the "best tasting" catagory!! I made some ajdustments to this recipe though. I used 1 cup of heavy cream and 2 cups of 1% milk instead of half and half. Also, I made my own chocolate wafer crust and did not put any whipped cream on the top. I also layered the chocolate/peanut butter which was more visually pleasing. Very rich and delicious! I promise!

This is an easy but excellent choice for the Peanut Butter and Cholocate lover. I layered the Chocolate and then Peanut Butter instead of all one and the other. My family loved it.

Everyone loved it!! I had to make 2 more the same week. I didn't use the whipping creme but did reserve a little of the chocolate to use for decorating the top of the pie in a "pinwheel" design.
