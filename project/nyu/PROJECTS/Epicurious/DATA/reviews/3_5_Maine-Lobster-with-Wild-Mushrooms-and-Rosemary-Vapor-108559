This dish was worth the effort, though I would say it is not that difficult. We reduced the butter portions to one half cup in total and the flavoring was just right. The next time we think we'll add additional mushrooms. Regarding the "vapor", we omitted the boiling routine and saved what we had cut for another dish. Make certain you have some good French bread, good bottle of wine and you'll have a wonderful dinner!

It is great served over risotto. Tonight I am axing the rosemary and using saffron instead.

Just need to get this recipe rated so folks won't overlook it due to poor ratings. It is excellent! We entertain a lot and this is probably the dish that has presented the best. It is beautiful and delish. It does require some work, but who cares? I'm making it tonight.

Well love the Rosemary Vapor and the lobster but the mushrooms seemed to over power the dish. It was too much work for such a bland outcome.

This is excellent. For those concerned about the butter content, just use less. That's what I did (about 1/2 of that called for) and it came out super. For those obsessed with the rosemary, just relax and leave it out too. Cooks aren't afraid to change a recipe. PS - I'm amazed that people who have time to comment on recipes they haven't tried would talk about chefs who supposedly have "too much time on their hands." Talk about pretense... PPS - had almost this exact dish in Paris.

Sorry Folks, but the Emperor has no clothes. I hate to be the first person to shoot the recipe down, but here goes. What a complete waste of a couple of wonderful lobsters. I followed the recipe exactly except to half it, as it was just for my wife and I on Valentine's Day. I live in New England and eat a lot of lobster (In one 2 week vacation Down East I set the goal to eat 100lbs of lobsters while I was there. Granted I only got to 75lbs, but I tried) in many different styles and recipes, from chowders to bisques, from omlets to eggs Benedict and from Newburg straight through Thermadore. So when I saw this recipe, I was intrigued, but it seemed to me that the Chef who created this dish maybe had a little too much time on his hands. I guess my basic complaints are that the flavor was not that great, the stock was way too buttery (and I LOVE butter) and the rosemary completly overpowered the meal. I know chefs like to come up with new ways to serve the King of Crustations, one local restaurant was serving chocolate dipped lobster claws last night, but there is definitly a line between creativity and pretensiousness and here that line was crossed.

Haven't tried it yet, but I can defend the idea of a rosemary nose. I make a orzo dish heavy in fresh rosemary and my company just love the scent as it rises from the plates! This is next on my to do list!

This is a fantastic dish. I served it as a starter (an elaborate soup) for a group of foodies. I made it exactly as printed and even did the rosemary vapor - we have bushes of it around here. EVERYONE was totally impressed, me included, and these are people not easily impressed by food. Recommendations: 1. Use top notch wild mushrooms 2. undercook the lobster as it cooks more later 3. prep in advance -it assembles quickly 4. Don't tell guests how much butter used ! 5. if you have rosemary in your yard, do the vapor - certainly starts a conversation if nothing more. Don't knock the recipe without trying it. This is something you could have at a place like 'The French Laundry' in napa - it is really impressive.

A wonderful main course that is fairly simple to put together. It's a rich (no wonder, with all that butter!) blend of flavors that compliment each other. By preparing some parts of the recipe ahead, the meal is almost effortless the day its served. Don't laugh at the vapor. We've all had experiences with fellow diners wearing too much perfume, or choking on the smell of scented candles as we dine. These odors are offensive as we eat, and they make the food taste 'off'. If, instead, a compatable, yet subtle fragrance is present, it enhances the flavors of the food. I used an assortment of fondue pots, butter warmers, and teapots with warmers placed around the dining room to keep the vapor hot, and the scent lively. The dinner was a big hit, and I'm preparing it again for Valentine's Day.

This dish was amazing. I loved the Idea for the rosemary vapor. It definately added a new dimension to the meal. For all you people who wrote and without even trying the recipe, maybe you should give it a try and educate yourselves!!!!

This was fantastic. And although I was mocked (a lot) for the pretentiousness of the recipe... the vapor had a huge impact on the flavor.

What in the hell is this? Has anyone actually tried this recipe? Seems like someone has WAY too much time to come up with a recipe, must be a saucier!

I didn't make this, but from the picture it looks divine!

I have to agree that this recipe is different, but I'm willing to give it a try just for the creativity aspect. One question though, when I read the recipe in Bon Appétit, it almost seemed to me that the last line of the instructions was left out. After pouringthe boiling water into the bowls of rosemary, what then? Do you simply place the bowls around the table or near the serving bowl or in your lap or what? Considering the fact that I've never used or seen the use of a vapor to accent a recipe, I think the Chef should have instructed a bit more in the placement of the vapors. I'm willing to try any recipe once and especially any recipe with lobster, which I am thoroughly addicted to. Anybody got any idea's on the correct placement? Thanks in advance!

Apologies for posting a comment before trying the recipe, but I wish to defend the use of a "vapor" in the dish. The vapor has two justifications that I can think of: 1) rosemary is firm and bitter but smells divine and 2) scent accounts for so much of what we call taste. The vapor, then, is the best of both worlds--the aroma of rosemary minus its bitterness and texture. And it's easy to do--just like making a tea. I've dined Trio, had the vapor, and the concept is a success. If I were to take issue with this recipe, I'd probably address the over 3 sticks of butter called for. Nevertheless, I'm excited to finally try a Trio recipe. To my knowledge, this is the first one available online.

Sorry, never done this before, but I think this is a chef's recipe gone mad. Rosemary vapor?? Please.
