One fork means okay and I guess this recipe was okay after a boatload of seasoning. I made the soup as directed and it was tasteless even after adding salt and pepper. I simmered it with some thyme which made it edible.

I've made this twice. Suggest replacing water with stock (chicken) and doubling the sherry. Add salt! Otherwise, awesome

I used chicken stock instead of water really brought out the flavor. & used baby bellas and shallots instead of onions. I also added a little dollup of sour cream. tasted great!

As the recipe is written it probably would have been a bit bland. However, I used veg broth instead of water, sauted garlic w/ the onions and mushrooms and used a sprig of very pungent rosemary. delicious!

Not what I'd hoped for. I did make some subs...used vegetable broth in place of water, doubled the sherry, and added thyme. I had to keep adding additional seasoning because it was just really bland. Will search out different recipe for next attempt.

I used vegetable broth in place of the water, and puréed more than half the solids, because I prefer a thicker cream soup. Would cut the sherry by about 25%, as it seemed to overpower the dish, in my opinion, although the dinner guests loved it. A definite "keeper."

I followed the suggestions below to add garlic and thyme--simply delicious. I didn't puree half--simply used my stick blender for a short time to create half puree/half chunky. I also used vegetable broth instead of water. A huge hit with guests!

I skipped the onion and chives (allergies), added 1 tsp dried French tarragon, and replaced some of the water with turkey broth. It was delicious! Very mushroomy.

I agree with the previous reviews that this soup was, by itself, a little on the bland side. However, the extra sherry, along with some garlic and balsamic vinegar did seem to help. I topped it off with some freshly shredded white cheddar cheese which gave it some extra kick. Preparation was extremely quick and easy, so that was a bonus.

The person that said it lacked pizazz was certainly correct, as is the soup will be a little bland.....I added some saffron, about 4 ounces of bud light(thats what i had), 2 cloves of chopped garlic, a drop of balsamic vinigar, and a few extra tablespoons of sherry.....Perfect.

I'm not the cook in the house and I was able to make it easily and in no time.

This soup is delicious, quick and easy. I must admit that I used the recipe as a blueprint and made a few modifications. I used beef broth instead of water, and will substitute a homemade mushroom broth (from leftover stems and trimmings that I keep in the freezer for just such purposes) for the water when I make this for my vegetarian friends. I have used white wine instead of sherry when I'm out of sherry, and half & half instead of heavy cream to reduce the amount of fat. Using a hand-held immersion blender cuts down on the dishes to wash. Adding fresh tarragon or thyme adds another dimension to the soup, but if you love the pure earthy flavor of portobello mushrooms, you can skip the herbs.

Save time and avoid washing the blender...use a hand held blender wand right in the pot to partly puree. Like others, I used what I had on hand; half and half and chicken stock. Added a sprig of tarragon for flavor and lots of salt and pepper.

Very bland! No pizzazz! Maybe needs some garlic, shallots instead of yellow onion, balsamic vinegar instead of sherry! It needs something... Had this for lunch just now, husband said no go (loves MUSHROOMS), cooked it down to be served in the future over pasta.

My hunter-gatherer husband showed up with 4 huge portobellos that someone gave him at work. We were watching Survivor and I couldn't start cooking until 9pm. Soup was done at 9:45 -- we each had a big bowl and felt quite satisfied. It was yummy. I doubled the recipe, and used 1 pint of half and half and 1 pint of skim milk for liquid. I also used a little olive oil with the butter, since I didn't have enough butter. Chives were fresh from garden.

I substituted tinned beef broth for the water. The flavor was rich and meaty, and the color fine.

As a novice cook, I'm always on the look-out for easy recipes...This was great. It was really tasty. I used half water/half chicken broth as others did...good suggestion. Also, accidentally I used very dry sherry instead of medium. Tasted fine.

Fantastic. Really easy, full of wonderful flavor. I used about half chicken broth, half water - I'm sure either would be good. Didn't have chives, so used the green parts of scallions finely chopped. Will definitely make again.

I wasn't too impressed, but my boyfriend liked it. I like the way the sherry adds flavor, but I would recommend subbing chicken broth for the water like the other people did. Also, I only pureed 1/4th of the soup and mixed it all together - it gave it a nice consistancy.

I made this soup tonight. It looked awful and the only one who would eat it was the dog. I must have done something wrong. This recipe did not say how to prepare the portabella mushrooms... only the way to cut them. Should I have disgarded the gills of the portabellas? Anyway it was a bummer at our house.

Fantastic! Even my 3 year old that eats Campbell's or nothing loved it. She gave it a thumbs up!

A luscious, satisfying soup. I served it as a first course and everyone asked for seconds. Doubled the recipe, adding more chives and sherry. Instead of water, I combined two-thirds low-salt chicken broth and one-third beef broth for richer and more robust taste. As a final touch, I stirred in fresh grated nutmeg. Excellent!

I tried the recipe twice. First I used homemade chicken stock in place of water, second I used water. Fear for my figure made me substitue 2% milk for the heavy cream both times. Much to my surprise, the version made with water was far superior! The water seems to intensify the mushroom taste. The second time I made the soup I also made sure that the puree was very smooth: this thickened the soup beautifully. I am sure that this recipe is even tastier with heavy cream, but I was really pleased with my second version.

Wonderfully flavorful without a lot of effort -- the best kind of recipie! I found that it ws even better when I placed a 3X3 inch 1/8th inch thick piece of brie cheese in the bottom of each bowl before ladelling in the hot soup.

Very easy, yet very good. Tastes as though hours were spent in the kitchen!

OH WOW! A culinary no-brainer which is comparable to best soups I've had in restaurants. I too subsitutued, using mocha mix and 1 tsp. cornstarch for the heavy cream. Don't forget the sherry!

Delicious! I made a couple of changes; instead of cream, I used skim milk. I also soaked dried porcini mushrooms in hot water, chopped up the reconstituted porcinis and added them to the soup, along with the soaking liquid(instead of just water). These changes made the soup healthier, but it still tasted rich and flavorful.

This is the best Cream of Mushroom soup I have ever had. I generally dislike any Cream of Anything soup but this one was delicious. I did use the chicken broth in place of the water, doubled the amount of butter, and added some fresh ground pepper. It was great. Also, I did something delicious with it for Thanksgiving too. They always advertise that Green Bean Casserole to make with Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup, canned green beans, and French's Fried Onions and it is always ok - but not very good. This year I used this recipe with fresh green beans and my own fried onions - everyone raved about it. It was the first time ever that I witnessed the complete disappearance of this side dish at my family's Thanksgiving dinner table. Perfection at last.

I modified this recipe by using chicken stock instead of water and skim milk in lieu of cream. The soup was just as hearty and flavorful, but not as heavy.

Incredibly good. Put the sherry on the table in a dispenser & allow individuals to decide how much to shake on top. Really a taste sensation and very easy.

This soup was very easy and delicious.Use fresh ground pepper for a big flavor boost. I lightened it once by substituting evaporated skim milk in place of the cream and water and it was still very good.
