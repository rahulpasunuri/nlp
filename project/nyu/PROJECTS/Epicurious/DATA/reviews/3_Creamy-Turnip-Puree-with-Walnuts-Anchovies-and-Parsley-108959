I just made this for a dinner party. The turnip puree is so rich and sweet-nutty, I couldn't keep from tasting it. It's amazing there was some left. I used hickory-smoked salt, and there's just a hint of smokiness to it under the sweet. Rapture!

thanks to previous reviews I modified and suggest other mods. 2 small/med turnips w 3 parsnips; 2 cl garlic; pressure cook 5min+slow release; butter instead of olive oil; gorgonzola crumble instead of anchovie; cilantro mixed w/parsley. Would cut the cream to .25 cup and add milk/water - very thick; husband really wanted more white pepper. I think salt and white pepper liberally. Still keeps yummy earth taste of parsnip and turnip...for one craving that combo it's very good..

Great taste combination and a great use of turnips which our CSA loves to give out in fall/winter! I used substantially less cream than the recipe called for and substituted pecans for walnuts and it was very good.

We wanted to like this dish. The walnut mixture was good tasting but sickeningly oily and greasy. Perhaps omit the olive oil? At any rate, I won't be making it again. A pity--since our CSA ALWAYS packs turnips in our box and I haven't found a good way to cook them yet!

Very nice change from plain mashed turnip. I used white (purple top) turnips because they are sweeter - better contrast with the nut mixture. As usual all of the usual anchovie haters raved about this because I didn't TELL them about the anchovies. 8 year old nephew ate the leftover nut mixture as a snack.

If you're a mashed turnip fan you'll probably enjoy this dish. The anchovy-salty walnuts are a real novelty, adding much-needed pizazz to an otherwise blah side dish.

I made this for Christmas and it turned out so-so in my eyes, but the men in my family loved it. I liked it better as leftovers. I omitted the nuts because I am allergic to them. It is an interesting way to serve turnips and was very easy to make. I would make it again.
