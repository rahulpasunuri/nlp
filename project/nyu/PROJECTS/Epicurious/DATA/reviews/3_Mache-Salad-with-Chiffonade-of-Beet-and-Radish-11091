The simplicity of this recipe makes it easy to overlook and under-appreciate. I'm not sure what the creator intended, but I paired my last picking of mache for the season with roasted beets that I keep on hand for instant salads from the garden. In plating, I kept the vegetables separated by the greens. I served the salad as a separate course, to afford full appreciation of its contrast of color, taste, and texture. One must slow down to appreciate the simple beauty of this delicately sensuous salad. Its memory will haunt me until mache is back in season.

A couple of things. The beets turn the radishes a bright pink. There wasn't any seasoning, tho I did add my own. Once seasoned flavors were O.K, but no wow factor.
