Very tasty for a cold autumn day. I didn't have high expectations because I usually only eat lettuce in a salad or sandwich. However, I did enjoy this soup. I made no modification other than not peeling the potatoes and being very loose with measurements. And I served with a generous amount of parmasan cheese.

Simple and delicious. Added a few chili flakes, as suggested by others. Was a little short on lettuce, so chopped up a head of Baby Bok Choy and it turned out really well. Adding it to the recipe box.

The fact that this soup is so good is just plain nutty. I added a pinch of saffron, a tsp of anchovy paste (probably not enough to add a lot of flavor) and used white pepper instead of black pepper. I'm not a salt person, but make sure to use enough salt. It's reminiscent of a potato leek soup. Very yummy, very easy and great way to get rid mof CSA lettuce... Especially if you don't love salads! Can't wait to eat more leftovers tomorrow!

This was surprisingly wonderful. A great way to use CSA lettuce. I used a very dark green romaine-type lettuce. Only made half the recipe since I live alone. I added a celery stalk and 1/4 cup of portabello mushrooms and used olive oil instead of butter. I sprinkled feta cheese on it. The next day I added leftover red, black, & wild rice to it.

Great soup, I doctored it with more garlic, red pepper flakes, onion powder. Couldn't get it to puree smoothly in the blender, any suggestions? It ended up looking like parsley speckled soup. Did I not cook the lettuce enough?

We really enjoyed it - used white pepper and a dash of saffron. garnished w/ sour cream and bacon...we'll make this again!

It was a little bland, so I fried up some bacon, added a few splashes of white wine vinegar, dried onion, chipotle pepper powder, red pepper flakes, dried raisins, celery salt, and sea salt. Spiced it right up.

Excellent soup, came together quickly. I subbed olive oil for butter, used half green onions and half regular onions and romaine for the lettuce. added a couple of red pepper flakes for a little heat and pureed it with an immersion blender. I will make this again

I have to say I was very surprised by this recipe. My husband who is somewhat picky liked this enough to finish all the leftovers in the fridge, and that is saying something. I use this recipe to finish up the rest of the lettuce from our Community supported Agriculture veggie delivery, since we usually get a lot of lettuce and the hubby hates salad, it is perfect.

I've made this several times and my whole fam loves it. I add whatever veggies I have to it and it's always great. I also add rosemary in addition to the coriander. Would be hard to mess up.

This recipe is not worth it, very bland. I put it through a sieve after the blender to get rid of the slimy texture.

I used leaf lettuce and ended up with OK-tasting but slimy results. Even after pureeing, the texture was not acceptable.

Very nice subtle flavor. We don't eat a lot of butter, so the only butter I used was the last tablespoon to finish it. Used olive oil at the beginning; otherwise, left everything as is. As a main course this was exactly enough for 2 people. Will be making it again!

Very nice soup base. I used chicken stock and stirred in some crumbled goat cheese at the end for a slight twist. I also swirled the bowls with a dash of Tapatio for a little kick. That seemed to work well. As others have said, this is one you can play with and it's hard to go wrong.

I just made this soup to use up an old head of romaine. I used new potatoes and kept the skins on. I also added a handful of basil, extra garlic and extra S & P. This an easy recipe to change and play and with, depending what your tastes are or what's left in the fridge.

I just made this out of some romaine lettuce beginning to wilt in the fridge. I upped the suggested amount of ground coriander some, added 1/4 lime juice and, as other reviewers mentioned, used a fair amount of salt. To serve, I made a pretty spiral with very sparely used cream on top. Also: Sweet potato made the soup a beautiful colour, perfect for fall. I think I'll experiment with Indian spices & extras next time I make this dish, and just keep the lovely purely as my base!

I made some modifications and the result was a luscious green soup that I will make again and again. I used one small onion and one leek and I cooked them in the butter along with about a teaspoon of anchovy paste. I used a combination of romaine and arugula. I substituted cauliflower for the potato. I used chicken stock in place of water. I finished the soup with the juice of half a lemon and then put a swirl of meyer lemon infused olive oil on the top of each serving. I ate the soup hot but it would be equally nice as a chilled summer soup.

I made a mistake w/ this recipe that turned out really well. I put too much water in with the lettuce & potato, so the soup came out too brothy. But then I turned it into a vloute-- put some Greek yogurt in each bowl with some parsley & lemon, then dished the soup in on top. Then, to further combat the watery-ness, I toasted some croutons w/ garlic to go on top. It was really, really good.

Please trust me here, what this kind of soup needs is a very small amount of monosodium glutamate (MSG) - obtainable from oriental shops. Your soup will sparkle with flavour. You need just the tip of a teaspoon and reduce your salt in compensation. People tend to see MSG as unnatural or an 'additive', but it is as natural as salt. Don't be limited by your prejudices, try it.

I made this with week old lettuce from our CSA. The soup was amazingly good and flavorful. I had some fresh tarragon, so I added that as well. The soup turned out wonderful. Just a note of caution - this soup requires a good deal of salt to pull out the natural flavors.

This is a great basic idea for a recipe--it's almost foolproof and you can tweak it in a hundred different ways. I use half a potato and 1 head of lettuce to make a half recipe.

I can imagine a recipe with a more boring name. Still, can't judge a book bye the cover. I used romaine lettuce. More vitamins in the darker greens.

I tried the soup using lettuce, I really liked it as did everybody else who tried it. The second time I used beet leaves and it was incredible good, maybe even better than the first one.

I made this soup a day I didn't have much energy to cook. I did not expect anything great but I was happily surprised! On top of being very easy to make, the soup was pretty flavorful. I liked it!
