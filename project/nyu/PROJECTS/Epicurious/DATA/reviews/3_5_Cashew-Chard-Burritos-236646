loved it! the first night we used the chard leaves to wrap the burritos and were pleasantly surprised with how well it complemented the flavors -- kind of difficult to keep the filling inside though. the second night we added cheese and salsa and wrapped the filling in a flour tortilla -- still delicious!

I'm confused. If you tell us that a recipe is"delicious", why only two stars??? If there is something that doesn't work in the recipe, hence the lower rating, it would be helpful to know what that is. Otherwise, what's the point?

I made this for some vegan friends and it was a huge success. They all requested a copy of the recipe to take home!!

I substituted cauliflour for the tofu and it turned out great. Important to buy the biggest leaf chard you can find.
