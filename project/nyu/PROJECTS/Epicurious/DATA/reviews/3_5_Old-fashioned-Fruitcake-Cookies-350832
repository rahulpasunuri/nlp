Very good. Nice and filling. Didn't use glaze.

I was doubtful about this, as usually booze-soaked sweets aren't my thing, but these turned out really well. I made the recipe exactly as written, and made the candied orange too - so easy and my local stores charges way too much for it. My husband chose this recipe as the best of the 6 xmas cookies I made this year.

I chose this recipe looking to use up some fine candied fruit I got from our local farm market, Segona's. The battered work just fine as a drop cookie. (Cook at same temperature on parchment lined baking sheet for 25 minutes.) Didn't have candied cherries or dates, but what I had on hand worked fine: currants, raisins, candied orange peel and citron, and dried blueberries! I'd feel confident making this with any mix of dried fruit and candied citrus. I used the full 6 tbsp. of both liquors to soak the fruit because it seemed dry, and then added extra in the dough with no ill effect. I don't like powdered sugar glazes, so I tried a heavy sugar syrup (1/4 cup water to 1/2 cup sugar) flavored with a tablespoon of bourbon and sherry. Hubby and I liked them just as well without. Next time I'll try making the syrup with all booze to kick the flavor up a notch. With all the dried and candied fruit, we were surprised that these cookies didn't taste too sweet. They are a nice treat to have around when you are home for the holidays.

There must be a misprint with the recipe for the glaze---1 cup of sugar and 8 tsps of liquid doesn't even begin to make a really thick paste! The ratio of sugar to liquid is way off and you will definitely need to add more booze to even make the glaze spreadable, much less spoonable or "glaze" like. Next time I will start with 1/4 cup of sugar and go from there. With 1 cup, there was a lot of wasted sugar and booze!

I too love fruitcake (when made with real, dried fruits & candied peels, not the multicolored mystery stuff!). I thought these were delicious. I used store bought candied orange and lemon peels instead of making my own, I substituted amaretto for the bourbon, and only used amaretto in the glaze. If someone likes fruitcake, they will like these. However, if someone does not like fruitcake, don't think you're going to "turn" them with these. At least, mine didn't "turn" the "haters" at a Christmas social (tho people who like fruitcake loved them). Bottom line, if you like fruitcake these are cute, tasty and a nice portion size to snack on. They seem to keep well, too. Merry Christmas!

Made as written - not bad at all. To the "cook" who asks "Why can't we let fruitcake die? by A Cook on 12/17/08" - who's forcing you to make or eat it? I happen to like it as do lots of others and I promise I will never hold a gun to your head and force you to make or eat it. Merry Christmas - if that doesn't offend you - or even if it does - Merry Christmas anyway.

I may be the only one left in the world that really enjoys a slice of good fruit cake and a cold glass of milk, well I made these this morning for our Holiday Open House tomorrow,and was very pleased with them. Very tasty and will make a nice addition to the dessert table. Thanks for sharing. p.s. giving them to the Poker Guys for Christmas.

I thought these were just so-so-- definitely not sublime and not four forks worth. I don't think this counts as modifying the recipe, but I should say that instead of plain dried cherries, I used a mix of dried berries from Costco that included cherries. If I were to make these again I would make sure not to use cherries that had been pre- sweetened--way too much sugar. But even with that aside, the bourbon and sherry flavors didn't come out at all and all I could taste was the dried fruit. I had no problem getting the orange peel to dry, but I did think cutting and drying them was too much work for the quality of the cookie.

I haven't made fruitcake in years, but these seemed like a great, easy substitute. The little cookies are moist and delicious, and the icing and candied orange peel just make them even better. I had a little trouble with the orange peel drying out properly, but maybe that was just me.
