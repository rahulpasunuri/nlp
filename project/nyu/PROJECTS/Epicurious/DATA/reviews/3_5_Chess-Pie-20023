To those who did not like this must have done something wrong...this is an excellent "tart" and one I use in my restaurant, with rave reviews.

My mother used to make this. After trying it, I called her, because it didn't quite taste the same. She puts in 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice and two tablespoons of white cornmeal (the cornmeal is what I was really missing. It adds a nice texture to the pie.

I have made this type pie for years, I use my grandmothers recipe. Although somewhat different it makes an excellent pie. Use 1 1/2 cups sugar, 1/2 stick butter, 3 eggs, 1-T flour 1/4 cup buttermilk and 1-T flavoring. I use lemon or coconut, both are excellent. Bake at 350 for 30 to 40 minutes. Knife stuck into center, comes out clean...pie is done. This pie can be served slightly warm or ice cold.

I expected a custard-like pie and what I got was an over-sized lemon square. A grainy and soupy one at that. I definitely would not make this recipe again.

Do not make this recipe without two changes: use 3 whole eggs, not yolks, and add 2 tablespoons of corn meal. Otherwise it does not set properly. Epicurious needs to change this recipe.

Excellent!! Use fresh lemon, and trust the recipe (it will puff some while cooking, and it looks undone after 30 minutes but it will cool and refrigerate to the perfect texture). Melts in your mouth!

My family is fond of this type of dessert. We like its tart sweetness.

This pie tasted great, but it had me in knots! I was serving it for company, and the 25-30 minute baking time is just not long enough. I wound up baking it for almost an hour. I would definitely not make this again.

I made this pie for the first time and took it to a family gathering. It was a big hit! It's very rich though, so cut in small pieces.

This simple southern treat remains my personal favorite.
