Perhaps I used too much ginger, but my result was spicy and hot! I'll probably try toning it down next time. That being said, my 13 yo LOVED it, but my husband refused to eat it. Go figure.

Super easy and very tasty. I would cut the butter slightly if I did anything. I made these for Thanksgiving this year and could have easily made twice the amount because they were gone in a flash. Definitely a new tradition.

i made a couple very simple changes which i think made a big difference. i steamed the carrots in juice covered and then boiled off the liquid when tender. i added a bit more ginger and sauteed with about 2 tbs butter. then added carrots to the butter mix and topped with a little brown sugar and generous salt and pepper. yum!

I adjusted this recipe, using 1 lb carrots, 1/2 c orange juice, 2T butter, 1T honey, and 1T ginger. It came out absolutely DELICIOUS! Would make this one over and over again, so easy and yet so elegant on the plate!

My baby loves it. Make in large qty. and freeze in individual servings. I'm working on my 3rd. 5# batch.

I made this last night for an outdoor party for 10. Decided to try something different from my standard lemon-basil carrots. Very easy to make and quite delicious. At our altitude (7000 feet) it took a little longer to reduce the sauce and glaze the carrots. It went wonderfully with my tarragon chicken and orzo.

Yummy...I used organic rainbow carrots and it was a colorful, flavorful dish.

I made this recipe cutting back some on the sugar and a little on the butter and it turned out delicious. Next time I will use a larger saucepan so it will cook faster, as it took longer than the recipe stated because I used a small one. Very easy to make.

I love carrot with ginger. It is especially good in this recipe. The ginger balances the dish nicely against the richness from the butter and the sweetness from the sugar and o.j. If you are using carrots from your own garden omit the sugar and cut back on the o.j. If you are using store bough and don't want your carrots as sweet, cut back on the sugar. I would leave the o.j. (it may sound strange but is worth leaving it in). My husband loved them and am bringing these to a dinner party next week (and I am NOT a confident enough cook to want to share my results with people other than my family). I, too, used baby carrots cut lengthwise. I think I like the presentation of the lengthwise baby carrots instead of the the round large carrots.

Tried this tonight and it was a hit, a definite keeper. Husband: "Tastes like a fancy restaurant's vegetable dish" Carrot hating son "I really like these carrots!" Reduced butter to 2 Tablespoons, followed the recipe for everything else. Excellent blend of flavors!

Fixed this with roasted chicken and smashed taters-yum! The ginger could have been overwhelming had I used the required amt, but I did use less and it was perfect. A nice change of pace.

I wasn't sure about this one (the oj), but I and everyone I served it to loved it. Great make ahead dish with wonderful flavor. I used baby carrots.

Sorry.....served this for Thanksgiving and it did not go over well. I think it is because the carrots tasted like orange and not like carrots.

This is so easy to prepare and is light, not heavy. This definitely goes in the "keeper" file for a mid-week vegetable side dish.

Excellent side dish. Guests loved it. I made the dish with baby carrots and quartered them lengthwise so they were small and held the flavor more. Had them on the stove simmering for more like 15 mins vs. 10 in recipe.

These were a nice change. I used baby carrots, brown sugar (instead of white)& cilantro instead of parsley. Great with an soy marinated steak.

terrific....easy to make ahead, used baby carrots, love the ginger....so did everyone else.

Excellent!! The carrots remain a little crisp but that adds to the overall taste experience!! The one cup of orange juice and butter was needed in order to cook the carrots but I did drain most of this sauce when I served it. The carrots held the orange flavor. I also added the parsley at the end so it would remain fresh and not get too limp.

The ginger cleans out your passageways! They are a good accompaniment to milder dishes.

This is an easy and delicious recipe for carrots. I have made this ahead of time and they reheat beautifully. The fresh ginger flavor really comes through --- my guests loved them.

Rating: 4
Great, easy recipe! I made ther carrots a day ahead of time, chilled overnight, then reheated and served in a chafing dish at a party. I got a number of positive comments from guests. Only comment I would make is to cook the carrots a little longer than the recipe calls for.

Very easy to make and loved the flavours - the ginger was subtle but made the difference between wow and okay. Great recipe compared to run-of-the-mill glazed carrots. Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it - even the person who didn't like cooked carrots - she had second helpings!

Very easy, and great flavors! I cut the recipe in half for a family of four, but kept the same amount of ginger(Can't hepl myself when it comes to ginger)

Very easy and terrific flavor change from run-of-the mill glazed carrots. I made these for a family holiday dinner and everyone raved about how tasty the carrots were. Even the children ate them!

This recipe is incredible! Instead of grating the fresh ginger I put in some slices and removed them when I was serving. It still added great flavor!

A delicious and really easy side dish, equally good with meat or poultry. Made this instead of sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving and had everyone coming back for seconds... One note is that I used "Ginger Juice" a wonderful product I recently found, in place of the fresh ginger...this made the dish easier to prepare and in my opinion, a tad more elegant as there were no flecks of ginger in the saute.
