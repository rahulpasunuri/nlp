Good recipe. I'm an inexperienced cook, and it basically worked. I followed all the directions in order (not the alternate approaches in the comments). I think that all the cook times listed are maybe too short to get the potatoes to cook through and the cauliflower not to be too hard. Once it was all simmering, I tasted it and decided to follow the other comments to pretty much double the spices. Added salt, too. Added more water along the way, too, to help the potatoes and cauliflower cook. It turned out pretty darn good.

Delicious! My 13 year old son had two heaping plates and couldn't believe it was Vegan. I did add a little more water before adding the tomatoes and green peas, but otherwise followed this recipe completely. Served it with some mango chutney. Yummy. I will definitely be making this again.

I changed up the order and cooking method of come of the ingredients to save time. I start by sauteing the tofu in oil, to get the cubes cripsy on all sides. While this is working I steam the cauliflower and boil the (red, cubed) potatoes. Then I add the garlic, onion, ginger, and seasonings to the tofu until all are cooked. The tomatoes are added next for 3 minutes, the peas for one minute, then the (still hot) cauliflower and potatoes are added. I needed to move the entire mix to a large mixing bowl in order to complete the seasoning. Don't pay any attention to the amounts for the salt, curry, additional spice, etc...just season to your taste.

As noted by another reviewer, a previous review skewed the ratings on this recipe by posting the same negative review 4 + times. I would give this 3 1/2 forks -- but I made it 4 to make up for that. I thought it was very good, and quite hearty/satisfying for a vegan recipe. I made very few changes, only added a generous dash of cayenne pepper for spice. I also kept the lid on the simmering cauliflower a bit longer than specified so it would cook more fully. I might try roasting the cauliflower in the oven next time and adding it back to the pan at the very end, for a more caramelized flavor. Really enjoyed this and it made a generous amount, fed two hungry adults for 2 nights.

Bake cauliflower early. Add red pepper flakes.

Very bland. The veggies need to be salted right from the beginning. Double all the seasonings and add a few tablespoons of chili paste and some lemon. Also, curry needs a good 40min of simmering for the cauliflower to soften and the flavors to permeate. You can tell this dish was never tested by an Indian.

Enjoyed this tremendously. Added more than 1 cup of water to create extra sauce. Needed more salt than I thought. Next time I'll try salting potatoes up front. Also felt it needed more kick than just the curry powder so I added cayenne. Overall, I plan to make this again soon.

This recipe gets a bad rap from a single disgruntled reviewer, whose review appears three times. : ( The recipe is fine; I happen to like spicy, so I ignored all the measurements and threw in some hot peppers to boot. I also pre-roasted the cauliflower and tofu, and added them in towards the end. Also, in what universe do frozen peas take 10 minutes to cooK?! Give'm three at the max. :)

The flavor was more mild than I expected even after increasing the spices, still a nice flavor but not as intense or spicy. All the vegetables came out nicely. I would make this again but alter the spices some more.

I made this for friends and they took seconds, which is a good sign of a successful dish! After reading the other review, I did pre-sauté the cauliflower to make sure it cooked thoroughly. The spices were mild but pleasant, next time I'll tweak to make it hotter. I think tastes for curry vary widely, so you should expect to make adjustments.

This was definitely just ok. To be fair, I didn't have any tofu or dry mustard, maybe those items would make the difference? We generally like dishes with lots of veggies, but this just a little bland and boring. I increased the garam masala and added a fair amount of salt in the end. I also let the veggies cook for significantly longer than the recipe called for. After 15 minutes of gently simmering the cauliflower was still raw! I won't be making this again.
