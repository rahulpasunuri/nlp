Delicious! Like other reviewers, I omitted the mushrooms as unnecessary. I added 1 clove minced garlic to the dressing and sprinkled freshly grated parmesan on top to balance the acidity of the lemon. Makes a great summery side dish.

super tasty. a HUGE hit at church picnics and family gatherings, HOWEVER... it takes an entire HOUR to prepare!! Carve out the time or have a helper because it's not a quickie.

While others raved (note: four forks means exceptional), I gave it two forks. Did you realize there's no way to mark a recipe as dreadful, awful, or truly disgusting? Hmmm. Anyway, I have made it twice. The first time I followed the directions exactly (minus the water). What I didn't care for was how the balsamic vinegar turned the fennel root an ugly color. I found it too sour for my taste. The second time around I substituted white balsamic vinegar, and added some thinly sliced Asian pear. It added a sweetness that helped balance out the tang. In both cases I added the mushrooms. Looking back, I don't think I'd use them again. The flavor is too subtle so it ends up being a filler rather than a specific taste. What I would give four forks is the use of fennel root. I too had never tried it because I was sure I'd have a dish that tasted like Licorice Allsorts!

For whatever reason I've never cooked with fennel bulbs before so I decided to give it a try. Really glad I did, this is an easy, light, crisp salad that I'll be making more of. The fennel tastes strong on it's own but mellows somehow once it's all mixed together and the flavors are great. Not a fan of raw mushroom so I left them out and like someone else said the water in the dressing didn't seem right so I left it out as well. What little leftovers we had were quickly eaten up the next day.

I made this a part of a family meal on a very hot day and it was really good. I also used white balsamic, but would probably use regular next time. I sliced the fennel very thinly and used only 1 1/2 bulbs. I added a teaspoon of dijon mustard to the dressing and omitted the water. I don't know why you would add water to salad dressing.

I made this recipe with the Guam "Volcano" Tuna, and it complimented the Tuna so good! The salad was light and had a great mild flavor. It was easy to make and tasted fresh.

Modified version review: Delish! And such a good refreshing alternative to cole slaw or really vinagery salads... I skipped the mushrooms, did equal amounts fennel and beans, used 3 green onions instead of chives, used white balsamic vinegar. Will mix together everything minus the beans sooner - it was FANTASTIC the next day, but the beans turned brown from the lemon/vinegar. So good.

This is a great side dish. I was skeptical because I don't usually like fennel. I used white balsamic vinegar instead of regular, and I used a bit more salt and pepper than is probably healthy - but my guests loved it. The only reason I didn't give it four forks was because it seemed to need a bunch of salt and pepper. But honestly, it's great.

An excellent summer side dish with great visual appeal. Very simple and delicious.
