Yum! This recipe was delicious. I made this as a side to Jerk Chicken and it made the meal. I was a little worried that the leftover salsa would not keep for a few days but it was fine.

So good I just wanted to eat it with a spoon! I added cilantro, otherwise followed recipe, and served on black bean tacos with fajita veggies.

YUMMY! Great with grilled fish and Jerk Chicken. Added red onions and sprinkled cumin. Will definitely make it again & again!

Superb. Instead of the jalapeno, I used a mix of smoked Spanish paprika and chipotle powder. A great salad with grilled fish!

I used this recipe as a base for my salsa. Did not have avocado, but everything else. I used lemon and lime juice. I added chopped mint and cilantro (about tbs each). I also added some chopped red onion (after soaking in cold water for 30mins. It's a lot of chopping, but it is delicious!

Beautiful and easy. I added cilantro because I love cilantro. Oops forgot the salt & pepper but still awesome. Made it with Chili rubbed shrimp also from epi.com. Great.

What a delicious dish! I served it with a mixed grill and have made it again without the avocado, simply because I had none, and it was still yummy! Definitely add fresh cilantro to your liking. I used tiny key limes, 2 or 3. I had no jalapeno, so added tabasco. I used Trader Joe's frozen mangos, picking the firmest pieces for mincing. Cannot wait to try it exactly as written, and then experiment, such as adding mint or a splash of balsamic vinegar. No need to seed the tomato - did the first time, but not the second with no difference.

Amazing with grilled swordfish.

An excellent salsa! I used about half the lime juice though, and add cilantro. Excellent with baked wonton chips or baked whole wheat tortilla chips.

Fresh tasting and beautiful. A perfect summer salsa. I made it exactly as the recipe states and it was great. We served it with grilled chicken breast. I think it would be good with some cilantro in it, but I knew that one of our dinner guests dislikes it, so did not add it. Maybe some other time....Will definitely make this over and over again!

The avacados complimented the mango taste very nicely. It was wonderful!

This recipe is amazing. I have used it with tilapia, grilled salmon, as a filling for veggie spring rolls, and as an appetizer with chips. Each time it has been a hit!

This salsa is a standard in my house, that is, when we can get a ripe mango and a ripe avacado at the same time! I usually have to hide some of it from my husband so there will be some left over for me. Goes perfectly with almost any spicy dish.

This was very good. I substitited red onion for the green onions (didn't have green onions on hand). I served it with tortilla chips as an appetizer--I bet it is great with grilled fish or chicken!

Used serrano chile instead of jalapeño, it's a much more flavorful chile, but do cut the quantity down a lot if you sub. Serranos are about 5 times hotter.

Sweet, smooth, tart, and hot all in one bowl. Great as a dip. The entire bowl was gone in about 30 minutes, and I was eating the scrapings before washing it out. Be sure to seed and juice the tomato well, or it will thin the salsa too much.

Outstanding! Easy to make -- I used it as a dip with bread and crackers. Skipped the jalapeno but everyone raved!!! This is a keeper.

This is the perfect side-dish. I used it with grilled chicken and pork

This was a big hit at a gathering I hosted. I got many comments on it and was asked for the recipe. A very simple and direct preparation. A very fresh tasting result with well-balanced flavors. Excellent.

Made this as written. Loved it along with grilled shrimp marinaded in Carla's Citrus Marinade (this site). Both were so refreshing! All of the suggestions sound great! Both recipes are repeaters for this house!

Loved this! While on our honeymoon on Grand Cayman I had Mahi-Mahi topped with Mango Salsa and loved it. Now coupled with my favorite, Avocado, I'm in heaven! This didn't last 24 hours.

This was DELICIOUS !! I had no green onions so used 1/4 cup of chopped vidalia onion instead,and added oads of cilantro. We kept the "base" in the fridge for a week and added avocado each night to serve with 3 different meals: Grilled swordfish, grilled chicken (marinated in lime juice, olive oil and cilantro) and finally finished it off with tortilla chips. Super yummy summer salsa.

My husband and I thought this was wonderful! Very easy to put together but it looks as if you went to a lot of trouble. Had it over grilled halibut and will try it with grilled chicken breasts next.

This dish was wonderful, and so easy to put together. I used papaya instead of mango, and added some fresh orange juice to the lime. My husband loved it, we finished the whole bowl between the two of us.

This is a wonderful recipe. For extra crunch I added cucumber. For the reviewer who lost their black bean recipe I use one with onion, garlic, 1TBL fresh grated ginger, 1 tsp fresh thyme and 1/2 tsp allspice 3 16 oz cans black beans. add 3/4 cup oj about 15 minutes before serving.

This is an excellent alternative to everyday salsa. When I made this over the summer I added some corn kernels cut fresh off the cob as well as some cilantro. Delish!

The leftover salsa makes a great salad dressing. I just added oil and a little more salt.

I made this and served it with Beans and rice. However, I can't find the bean recipe again. I believe it had orange juice and maybe ginger or allspice in the recipe too. It was great. Then everyone went home and made a bowl of the salsa and ate it by itself.

What a zingy salsa. Don't get too heavy handed with the lime or it will overpower. I served with a seasoned, grilled chicken. Will try with black beans and rice next.

This salsa is a great, easy way to dress up grilled fish. We had it with sea bass that had been marinated briefly in a slightly spicy lime based marinade and it was a perfect complement. A keeper.

Excellant with tuna steaks. Now I'm serving it with Sea Bass. The proportion of lime, pepper, and fruits seems to be just about perfect.
