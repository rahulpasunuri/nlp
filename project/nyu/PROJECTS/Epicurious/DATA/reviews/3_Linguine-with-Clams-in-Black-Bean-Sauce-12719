I substituted 3 cans of clams for the fresh and added almost a pound of spinach to make it a very fast and easy meal.I also used mirin instead of scotch but did not use all of the clam juice in the cans

I followed this recipe exactly as written. The sauce is SUPERB! However, we did find it to be a bit aggressive for the clams and linguine. I can't wait to make the sauce again and use it in a stir-fry (subbing the Thai chicken stock also on this site for the clam juice).

My husband loves this dish and would give it a 4, but he likes salt alot. I've made this twice, the first time with sake, the second time with sherry. Both times, canned clams and black bean garlic sauce. The second time I added some thinly sliced zucchini and will add vegetables in the future, but it stands on it's own. The liquid in the cans is salty and in the future will use less of it and add water. The sauce is creamy and tasty surrounding the linguine.
