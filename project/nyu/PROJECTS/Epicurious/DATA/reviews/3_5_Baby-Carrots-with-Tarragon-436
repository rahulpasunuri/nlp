I loved this dish it was a great side dish with pork but i did add a splash more water during the cooking. I also cut down on the tarragon and added a mix of chives and parsley instead of more tarragon. I will probably take out the tarragon next time because it wasn't favorite. Over all it worked and I would make it again!

Every time I make these carrots I get rave reviews. One of our favorites! Lovely & just the right amount of sweet!

pretty boring dish, though I imagine it would be a good accompaniment to a super-salty meat like ham. Nothing about it really impressed me. It did get a little (very little) bit better when I tossed in some maple syrup and buttermilk-the buttermilk helped enhance the tarragon in particular. The syrup did a lot more for the consistency and depth than honey did, even though I used pretty strong honey.

had the luxury of buying veggies at a local farmer's market--delicious! crisp, light (use only 1/2 the oil), and very colorful. they got more attention at an easter dinner than the garlic mash.

disappointing.not horrid, just not that good. I made the whole menu (artichokes, lamb & carrots) and overall was let down on each of the items.

Excellent!Served this dish last year with prime rib for our Christmas dinner. By request, my family asked me to make "those yummy carrots" I made last year. Served a beef tenderloin this year instead of the prime rib. Even the grandkids (not big veggie eaters) ate all their carrots. This is a keeper!

I simply love this recipe.

I love carrots, but not as prepared in this recipe. The first time I tried the recipe, I only had plain vinegar and thought that was the problem. To be sure, I tried it again using the white wine vinegar and the result was still terrible.

I used only about one-fourth of the carrots called for, as I was cooking for two, but I added nearly the full amount of the other ingredients. If I had not, I think the carrots would have been pretty bland. At the end of the cooking time, there was too much liquid left, so I reduced it to a thick sauce and poured it over the carrots. This is a tasty side dish, and easy to make. Be sure to save some of the fresh minced tarragon to sprinkle on the top, as the tarragon cooked with the carrots turns a rather gray shade.

A nice sidedish for chicken. I used packaged baby carrots. My tarragon was not overly fresh so I imagine it would be better with fresh herbs.

Baby carrots are a favorite in our household and this recipe was a big hit!!! The tarragon-honey combo was surprisingly delicious. Really simple to prepare as well.

Fabulous! Nothing needs adjusting - this is the first recipe I've rated that has perfect flavor proportions. It's a wonderful way to enhance carrots - a bit sweet, savory and buttery. And, above all, it's incredibly simple to make! As always, use fresh herbs over dried whenever possible.

I used regular carrots cut on a slant. They were the hit of the Easter dinner. Very unique flavor.
