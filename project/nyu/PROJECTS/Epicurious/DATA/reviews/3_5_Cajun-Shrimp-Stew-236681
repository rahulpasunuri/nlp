I loved this dish! It was my first gumbo type dish, and it was wonderful! I, among other reviewers, made a shrimp stock, and added clam juice. I made a bit more roux (1/2 c flour & 1/4 c oil), because I made about 5 cups or so of liquid (stock). I paired this with the cajun style rice recipe (on epicurious), which was simple to make. oh, I also substituted creole seasoning in place of salt (about 2 tbs) and about 1 tsp cayanne. I topped it with the scallions along with an added 1/8 cup flat leaf chopped parsely. Mine turned out very flavorful and perfect

I added a minced jalapeno and garlic. It turned out delicious. The roux took about 20 minutes to brown, but maybe because I was cautious not to let it cook too quickly and burn. I used half olive oil and half butter for it.

Oh! And I didn't use bottled clam juice. I boiled my shrimp shells in some water and added a little vegetable "Better than Boullion" to that. Quick and easy. Not the fabulous but complicated shrimp stock hubby makes, but it worked fine.

I thought this recipe was delicious and perfect as-is. My only modification was to use a little less cayenne because I knew ours was really fresh and I have a two-year old. Despite that, the stew had a great afterburn, and we discovered that our son likes spicy food just like mom and dad! I served it over plain white rice. I live in South Louisiana, and I think this tasted very authentic, as did my husband who was born and raised here. I will make this again - we have friends and family from all over the country, and this is one I will make for visitors, so that they can get the Louisiana experience. Maybe on the night between the crawfish boil and the fish fry! :)

Based on some of the reviews I added some dried red chilies and topped it with crumbled bacon. YUM! I'll be making this often! Good quick dish!

A recipe with great potential. Take kbroussa's modifications, and then quadruple, maybe quintuple the heat in the spices and you've ot a winner.

Is spicy enough, but still needed to be a little more robust. I added garlic, which seemed to do the trick. Also adding chopped tomatoes helped.

I am a native of Louisiana and grew up on our Cajun and Creole cuisine. For those of you who wrote that something is missing, try this. Increase flour and oil to 1/2 cup each and cook a little darker. Be careful not to burn the roux! Omit the clam juice and water and use 2 cups of shrimp stock instead. If you do not have shrimp stock, you might be able to find shrimp bouillon cubes either in the soup section or Asian section of your supermarket. Add 1 tablespoon minced garlic after onions, celery, and bell pepper have sauteed. Sautee the mixture with the garlic an additional 1 minute. Add 2 tablespoons tomato sauce with the stock/bouillon, add a bay leaf, and add black pepper in addition to salt (be careful; the stock/bouillon are salty) and cayenne. You can substiture any Cajun/Creole seasoning such as Zatarain's, Tony's, Pau Prudhomme's, etc. for the cayenne pepper. These do contain salt, so again be careful with the salt that you add. Also add 1/2 cup chopped flat leaf/Italian parsley when you add the scallions. Use both white and green parts of the scallions.

Just OK. As many other reviewers said, something was missing. It was a little bland. I added garlic and made the roux with butter, but it didn't help.

This would be excellent if I could just put my finger on that missing something. We did still enjoy it very much. This is one of those that I'm just going to have fun playing with.

Good but seemed to be missing something. Next time, I think I will make the roux with butter and not oil, which lacks flavor. Also, I added a couple of cloves of garlic, fresh rosemary and thyme to the leftovers, much better.

Wow. This was my first rue, and I'm impressed with myself. Actually, it was quite easy. Very spicy, but that's part of the experience, I guess. Good recipe.

Made this with the Bay Leaf Rice Pilaf. Mounded the rice in the center of the plate with the Stew around it. Can't wait to have this again. The blend of spices was perfect.

Very good as is, and perfect with the Bay Leaf Rice Pilaf.

This was good, but a bit bland. Also, I found I needed to double the amount of oil for the roux, and it took -- as most do -- at least 30 minutes to get it right. Don't be afraid to add pepper and a little Tony's.

Delicious and simple. Don't forget the scallions -- I almost did and they make a big difference. Definitely on the mild side, but very flavorful. I didn't stir the roux constantly and in a cast iron skillet it was fine. Served with rice and collards cooked with garlic, tomatoes and vinegar.

An excellent and easy recipe! My wife said this is definitely a keeper. Nicely straightforward and a real joy to eat with rice (though next we'll try it with capellini!). Make sure to brown the roux enough (took a little longer on my electric stove). And I used smaller shrimp because they were available peeled -- kept it easy and they were great! For us, the amount of cayenne was just right (a pleasant tingle), but others might want a tad more. This one is now a staple in my collection.
