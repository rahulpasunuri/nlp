These are super easy, but as mentioned in previous reviews it's the toppings that really make the bars great. I topped mine 3 ways - bacon/peanut brittle, pistasio, and candy cane. Everyone loved the bacon/peanut brittle version the best. Will definitely make it again.

Easy, delicious and awesome presentation. I made 3 types, popcorn, pistachio and crushed candy cane and salted all. I also used 7oz of semi-sweet chocolate. My new thing to bring when visiting friends. Love this recipe and love the ease of it too. It's a keeper.

This is not an extraordinary recipe, but it's a solid one that allows you to jazz it up by customizing to your tastes and the occasion. I brought them to a gathering and they got eaten up quickly. I made these with semisweet chocolate and chose toasted coconut, toasted almond slices, toasted walnuts and popcorn as toppings. I also used Maldon sea salt, which worked well. The cookie bar base is pretty sweet and rich, so I'd recommend against milk chocolate and many sugary toppings to avoid a result that's overly sweet (unless you like that). The popcorn made these stand out visually and makes them seem a bit more special and unusual - also gives some textural interest. Next time I'll try pistachios to give them a little color. If you use boring toppings these won't be at all remarkable.

These were easy, but came out pretty greasy. I think there are better toffee bars out there.

Really good and not hard! I made one batch but created three toppings sections -- chopped up heath bar, pecans and snickers. all were really good, but i think the heath might be my favorite.
