I gave this recipe four forks even though it is hard to imagine a sandwichwhich is what this basically israting so high. But for what it is, I thought it was exceptional. I did everything as directed by the recipe except that I used sun-dried tomato and herb wraps that I had left over from a previous meal. I bought high-end deli meats and coleslaw from the deli section of my grocery store. I bought broccoli to steam and add, but I forgot to include it. Next time, and there will be a next time, I might up the horseradish to give it more zipbut then I live in New Mexico and we are accustomed to some flavor. Thinking of that, I bet in addition to the red peppers green chiles would be good. This was a quick, flavorful, no-cook dinner ideal for a summer night.

Good combo of flavors. I used lavash bread which I love. Will store it with my sandwich ideas.

I'd give this one and a half forks. I wouldn't make it again without some changes but we did finish it. I guess I'm the lone dissenter, but maybe I didn't use the right coleslaw? I made it from scratch with a recipe I usually like...the horseradish taste was a little overwhelming also, I think a half tablespoon would have been enough to give it a little bite...and I usually like a lot of horseradish. I couldn't taste the red pepper at all as written.

I quintupled this recipe, refrigerated the intact wraps overnight, then cut them into bite sized nibbly bits for a large party. They were a huge hit and looked great on the serving platter. Most prepared coleslaws should probably be drained a lot before using (otherwise it's just a big sloppy mayonaise mess). Don't be alarmed if the horseradish slaw mixture is too spicy -- it mellows considerably once you roll it up with the rest of the ingredients. Because I knew I was going to cut each wrap into several morsels, I used the interior ingredients sparingly for neatness and wound up making sixteen wraps with the filling for ten.

This is for Carmie who can't find the coleslaw recipe. Just click right on "horseradish coleslaw" to get the link. Good luck.

A fantastic and unusual quick meal. I used the broccoli coleslaw packet in the produce section and everyone raved. My husband is already craving more!

This recipe was so quick and easy. I used packaged broccoli slaw to add a little more crunchiness and everyone loved it. Great compliment to the smoked turkey with chipotle mayo wraps on here!

Carmie, The recipe for the coleslaw is a separate link at the top of the recipe.

Nice combination of flavors. This makes an excellent, no mess roadtrip or picnic meal. Try pita bread instead of tortillas, shred cabbage for slaw and combine with peppers. Keep coleslaw and roast beef in ziploc baggies, then add horseradish to coleslaw dressing and store in a squeeze bottle.

Another good summer recipe...watch how much horseradish you use.
