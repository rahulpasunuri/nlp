This was ok. I followed the recipe except I didn't have the fresh basil. So I put in a few TB of pesto to substitute it. I think you will need to add other ingredients like the other cooks did to make this better.

Very nice! I adapted. Added dijon as one reviewer suggested to carry over flavors to the pork that had a dijon marinade. Did not have basil, and only had (oddly) raspberry balsamic which I figured would work to complement the pork also - but tastes amazing in its own right and will make sure to use it again. It's a great counterpoint to the lentils. Also added a big fat clove of garlic. Super tasty - though I haven't added the tomatoes yet cause I want to save for cold salad tomorrow. Did not need extra salt, thanks to the dijon. I think that the small French lentils make a big difference in giving this dish a more delicate flavor.

Delicious, nutritious, and easy to make. I omitted the red wine vinegar and instead used the juice of one whole fresh orange. I did not have dill on hand so I just added extra basil. Also I added two cut up celery stalks to the water along with a bitnofnred onion just to give it a little kick. I also toasted some pita bread and had olive oil for dipping. The dinner far exceeded my expectations and my husband loved it too.

Great start. I used fresh basil, dried oregano and lots of fresh ground pepper. Feta cheese, and fresh chopped tomatoes, black olives, marinated artichoke hearts. Add a splash of red wine vinegar and fresh lemon juice with nice olive oil and you've got a fresh Greek inspired lentil salad.

Wow! Amazing flavors! I didn't have fresh dill, so used dried in water with lentils & garlic. Used chicken broth instead of veggie. Flavors of fresh herbs and tomatoes along with texture of lentils made for an amazing dish.

Loved this. Didn't use french lentils, still turned out so good! I love epicurious.

great recipe. Add about a tablespoon of mustard (I used dijon) to the vinegar & oil to perk it up a bit.

Easy and flavorful vegetarian meal/side that gives you lots of room to play. I pretty much threw in whatever I had on hand and some of the substitutions were because that's just what I had. I used 1 1/3 cup lentils (green - but not French - and yellow), 3 garlic cloves, 1 t salt with the boiling water, about 2 1/3 cups of cut in half cherry tomatoes, 8 green onions thinly sliced, one cucumber sliced and quartered, about 1/2 of an orange bell pepper chopped, 1 can of drained chick peas, 1/2 cup sliced basil, 1/3 cup of chopped cilantro, 4 T of coconut balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup of olive oil, 2 T of lime, 1 T of dijon, crumbled feta and salt & pepper to taste. I served it with toasted pita with melted havarti cheese. Delicious and flavorful.

This is a delicious recipe and filling. Great for lunches or dinner before going to the gym/yoga. Saves well for a day or two especially if you only put the tomatoes in when you eat it. This recipe is delicious as is but I always add cucumber and feta because I like it. Have also used cherry tomatoes instead. You can do basil and/or dill. Once you've made it, it's pretty easy to just freestyle measurements! Worth making!

This is delicious. I've made it more than once and after the first time I started adding a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice. It's a great vegan recipe that doesn't "feel" vegan. It's been very popular with meat eaters and not alike.

Excellent! Easy and delicious. Perfect chilled for a summer lunch.

I made this as written and I enjoyed it. I had no idea the dill/basil combination would be so good. I do have to say it would have been even better with a little feta cheese. If you grow your own herbs, this is a very inexpensive, flavorful dish.

I followed this almost exact, added a few other fresh herbs I had, cilantro and parsley... what really made it for me though was I used heirloom tomatoes, simply incredible! I am always looking for some easy, cold but hearty vegetarian options and this is a winner!

Rating: 3
Very nice vegetarian option, fresh and flavorful, hearty enough to serve as a meal with a bit of hard cheese or saucisson on the side. Love having this in my summer-friends-over-too-hot-to-cook repertory. Not being a fan of dill, I substituted parsley, and it was fine.

This is good but not great. I've made better dishes from Epicurious. That being said, this is still a versatile dish that's very tasty and healthy. I followed the suggestions of other users and added cucumber and feta cheese. What a world of difference that made! I also used red-wine vinegar as listed in the recipe-I tried a little balsamic vinegar and found the taste not to my liking. Red-wine vinegar is definitely more suited to this dish.

added more garlic and grainy dijon mustard into the dressing; also the cucumbers as suggested. really good. worthy of more experimentation. great for vegetarian friends

My entirely carnivorous boyfriend loved this dish. Upon his third helping he exclaimed, "this is a hit!" I thought it was pretty good, especially compared to how easy it was to make. I would serve this dish again.

Once summer comes around, I make a double of this recipe about every other week. I have a couple of tweeks: 1) I only use dill 2)I use sweet red onions 3) I use a "light" balsamic vinegar -- like Trader Joe's. I often serve it with fresh mozzarella and french bread -- a complete meal. Yummm.

This was a great, easy recipe. I used dried dill and basil, and it still turned out great because the lentils give an awesome earthy flavor to the salad. I also added 2tablespoons of cilantro- an addition that i strongly encourage!

Truly and utterly amazing. Its like eating summer. Cherry tomatoes make it even better. Even lentil haters will love this.

This tastes like a breezy, sunny, beautiful summer day. I've made it about five or six times since I first made it in June, and I don't think I cooked more than ten times this summer! I add minced garlic and use balsamic vinegar. It's divine.

Made this as written and it is FABULOUS. I'm glad I doubled the recipe. I used green lentils, fresh tomato (store bought, on the vine, and some cherry tomatoes), fresh dill and basil, balsamic vinegar. I can't stop eating it.

Yum! Can't wait to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow topped with feta as another reviewer suggested.

I would give this 3.5 forks if that were an option. Made it almost as is, just a little extra garlic. Thought it was great and will definitely experiment with variations in the future.

This is a delicious and refreshing way to enjoy lentils and tomatoes - the dill and basil combo is great. Even better as a leftover.

We're moving to more meatless recipes, and this one was a big hit with my husband. I added chopped cucumber, chopped red pepper, chopped red onion, chickpeas and cilantro. Went really well with the Spiced Black Bean Burgers and the Spicy Roast Chicken with Tomatoes and Marjoram (without the chicken).

This salad may look boring, but it is so simple and fresh tasting, that it will become a staple here. We loved it. I made it exactly as written and will do so again.

Sooo good! I think it is better the next day. It's really versatile too, I've had it with mixed salad, over brown rice and solo, topped with feta. I added finely chopped cukes, red bell peppers and basil along with the tomatoes, scallions and garlic. One more tip- double the recipe, you'll be glad you did!

Naturally, fresh tomatoes are the point, but this also works well (and seems to keep longer) with drained, no-salt canned diced tomatoes. The previous reviewer who called it "addictive" is right!

Rating: 4
This is an excellent picnic or potluck dish, especially if you are vegetarian and aren't sure what the meatless options will be. Non- vegetarians love it as well! Chopped cilantro is a nice option, if you don't have any basil on hand.

I loved this salad. I wanted to make a double batch but only had enough French lentils for one so I added chickpeas. It was fabulous. I will make this again and again.

I made this as directed once before and it was good, but this time I used balsamic instead and it really made a difference. I also added diced cucumbers and diced red onions (after soaking) and it was great.

This is really easy to make and tasted good even with late winter cherry tomatoes. I added a little dijon to the dressing, thought it could use a squeeze of lemon as well. I halved the amount of vinegar like the others and was happy with the taste.

Since making this dish sev'l times last summer and enjoying it so, I almost lost my mind today when looking for the recipe to make today and couldn't find it! I jumped online and did a search, that speaks volumes about how much this recipe deserves four forks up! I made it with brown lentils before, but am trying it with the little red French lentils now. The dill makes the dish, don't skip on that. The taste is addictive.

This is a great vegetarian dish. I cut the oil in half because 1/4 c. seemed excessive. I doubled the garlic and cooked the lentils a bit longer until very tender. I also added the tomatoes to the drained lentils and cooked over low heat approx. 10 minutes (because winter tomatoes in NYC aren't the best). Next time I will only use 2 or 2.5 T red wine vinegar. I served the dish atop toasted whole wheat pita wedges, with a sprinkle of feta and a green salad on the side. Yum!

I made this for a dinner party I was hosting. I knew one of the guests is Vegan so I was looking for a side dish that she could use as a main dish. EVERYONE loved it and suggested that I make it for our church potlucks to provide more options for vegetarian members (including our minister). The leftover salad was just as good cold the next day as it was when I first made it. I followed the recipie exactly, even finding the small lentils to use. The one thing I would change in the future would be to use less oil in the dressing. I think the recipie would be just as yummy while being a bit more friendly to my waistline.

This was a big hit even with the children. I omitted the dill because I had none on hand, and also the vinegar because of dietary restriction. It was delicious. I think the garden fresh tomato, basil, and scallion had a great impact as well as good evoo.
