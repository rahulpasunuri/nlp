A hit on mother's day. The flavors all came together wonderfully. No good raspberries in my area, used fresh strawberries and was to die for. Use good quality honey, I used local raw sage honey. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I don't know why you'd want to double the cream, it's a tart that's 1 inch thick. Unless you plan to serve it on the side. But the cream is so good I'll be making it to serve with fresh fruit in the future.

Really easy, light and fresh. I chose to add all the honey to the cream mixture (which I doubled - also used equal parts creme fraiche to cream cheese) - I couldn't really taste the lavender, I would sprinkle lavender buds to increase the lavender flavour if you wish. I made four mini tarts. I did find that the crust was a little on the tough side and I had to use some force to cut into it - did anyone else find this also? Aside from that the fresh, tart raspberries work well with the sweet, luxurious cream and buttery crust.

Very easy, delicious recipie. Rather than make a whole tart and use pie weights I made individual, cupcake-sized tart, and like another reviewer said, put a piece of tin foil that was buttered. Make sure you don't cook them too long, I waited until they were golden brown in the oven and they cooked more when I took them out. Could not find lavender honey, so I used regular honey with a dash of vanilla. Also used sour cream as a substitute for creme frache. Perfect :)

Awesome summer dessert. Great for 4th of July if you mix blueberries in with the raspberries. Nice flavor and color contrast. Also I doubled the filling which was simple since you already have all the ingredients you need due to quantity of packages. I topped it with a hibiscus sauce instead of the honey. Also other reviewers are correct use any honey you have handy. Also topped whole thing with a little lemon zest. Again nice color and added another layer of flavor. To find the hibiscus sauce just type hibiscus in the search and it will come up under Almond Glazed Pastries...... Oh and I used mixed frozen berries in the hibiscus sauce to cut the sweetness of just using raspberries for everything. If you can't find hibiscus flowers, you can often find hibiscus tea in packages in almost any Mexican food store. Awesome - super easy to make and everyone loved it!!!

perfect summer raspberry usage- the sweet/tart, floral and tang flavors go together well. Made this several times so far.

One of the best tarts ever. The recipie was simple, and easy to follow. Easy to prep the day before, and assemble before serving. Like all the other reviewers I could not find lavender honey, so I used clove honey from a local honey company. I also used blueberries and raspberries, which made for a very patriotic looking dessert.

Really great recipe. Make sure you buy raspberries at the height of their season so the tart is delicious! I used a sping flowers honey since I couldn't find lavender, and it was wonderful. I personally thought it was a bit sweet, but my guests thought it was perfect, so I will make it exactly as directed next time also.

Wonderful! Not too sweet, not too heavy. I doubled the cream filling and used almost all of it in the tart. Used regular honey. (There is really minimal flavor difference in the various honeys.) I made the crust in advance and froze the unbaked shell. Without thawing, baked at 425 for 5 min and 375 for 15 min...don't need any foil or weights this way. Then brushed hot shell with some beaten egg white to moisture-proof it. (Pie shell hints from Rose Levy Beranbaum's Pie and Pastry Bible.) Will definitely make again.

Super easy and delicious! I used light cream cheese and substituted full fat sour cream for the creme fraiche - the results were great. Also used a local Ontario honey. Raspberry, honey, cream and a slightly sweet cookie crust - great combination!

Simple and tasty enough to make over and over without trying to overpower your tastebuds. I used a local honey I had on hand (not lavender), and forgot to drizzle it on top- no one noticed, it was wonderful. I think I might just skip that step again next time.

This is a delicious, simple recipe. I served this last night and the crowd was raving. The crust is basic and delicious. The sugar in the crust and the honey in the tart complement each other nicely. A perfect end to the meal.
