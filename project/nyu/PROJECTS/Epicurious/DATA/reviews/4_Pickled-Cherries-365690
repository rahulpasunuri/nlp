this cherry condiment was awesome! I'm making them again this year, but I will process them in small jars (125 ml) for about 10 minutes so I can give them as Xmas presents p.s. the Westmark cherry pitter is the best

Such a successful recipe, everyone raves about this. wonderful with a liver pate and cheeses such as a sharp english cheddar. This is the second year that I'm making these. Great for gifts

These are outstanding. They're perfectly sweet and tart with a hit of heat that makes me want to eat them straight from the jar. I realized I was out of coriander seed, so subbed brown mustard seed and left out the rosemary. I used black cherries and did not pit them so they would stay firm. Already planning another batch!

These were amazing! I had lots of family in town and everyone raved about them! I used a sprig of oregano rather than rosemary and cumin seed rather than coriander seed but the flavor was fantastic.

Wonderful change of pace to serve with pate. A surprise and delicious.
