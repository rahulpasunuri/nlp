The only reason this got only 3 forks is that the frosting is a little fussy (does not sit that well if preparing in advance of a big party). I use alternate frostings --a light cream cheese one is good. The cake is very flavourful. Oh, and the recipe makes more that 12 the last 3 times I made it. More like 24 normal-sized cupcakes.

Good crumb and beautiful texture in the mouth. I thought that it was a little too sweet with the seven-minute frosting and will be cutting back on the sugar either in the batter or the frosting the next time I bake this.

Excellent cupcakes but I used chocolate whipped cream icing and frosted the other half with coconut cream cheese frosting (both from this site) - these two frostings are much better w/these cupcakes, esp. the choc. whipped cream icing!

These were very good, however, I tried to make mini ones to begin with and that did not work. They were to difficult to frost. I made larger ones that came out but think the cake would probably be best.

Delicious! I only had a 7 ounce bag of coconut, so I didn't have enough to top all of the cupcakes, but I added food coloring to the frosting and they made a festive decoration and dessert at Easter brunch!

I really want to give this 3.5 forks! I decided to try these out for my very first baking experience EVER and was really happy with the result. They were moist and fluffy and I really liked the texture of the Coconut. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but added a dash of Almond extract in the batter and used a cream cheese icing. Will definitely make them again.

Great taste, excellent texture--a bit like a brownie and on the slightly less sweet side. 325 is a better temperature if you are using black/dark bakeware. Recipe calls for way, way more coconut than you will actually need. I used 1/2 of one bag. For frosting, I used the frosting from Lemon Pistachio Crunch Cake on this website, flavored with a few drops of coconut extract. This is a great frosting that can be flavored in many different ways and I pretty much use it on everything.

These are delicious, win rave reviews without fail. I like to play around and add chocolate chips, etc. I also did not measure the coconut per the recipe, I just added it to my taste

I followed the directions to make 2 9"layers. I baked it at 375 for about 30 minutes. You might try adding mini chocolate chips to the batter. I did not need anywhere near that amount of coconut, just 2 cups in the batter and some to put between the layers and around the sides of the cake. I filled and iced it with cream cheese frosting that had cream of coconut added.

Insanely good! I've made this twice - as regular- sized cupcakes and as a 9" layer cake (2 layers). Both came out wonderful. I took the previous suggestion of using the Barefoot Contessa's cream cheese frosting, which was perfect.

yuck! I must have done something wrong but these came out terrible. they totally fell in the middle, the texture was like wet sponge, totally inedible.

These cupcakes were very good, and everyone enjoyed them. However, the almond flavoring does not come through at all. I didn't want the stickiness of the 7 minute frosting so did Barefoot Contessa cream cheese frosting w/almond flavoring which worked well.

Delicious recipe! After reading some of the previous recipes I decided to add some almond extract to the frosting and it was wonderful!

Delicious! I thought the frosting was similar to marshmallow cream in taste and texture. I couldn't taste much almond flavor in the cupcakes, but they were still excellent.

These were divine! I made them in star shaped cupcake foils and served them on a cupcake tree-they looked fabulous and were moist and rich. So delicious!

The cupcakes were moist, chocolately and coconutty- but the frosting is horrible! Do not make the recipe for the Seven Minute Frosting as suggested because the amount of vanilla is way too much and the consistency is not like frosting, it's more like a meringue. After I made the Seven Minute Frosting and tasted it, it took me less than a minute to toss it! Use a traditional vanilla buttercream frosting instead!

This is a perfectly delightful recipe- the ingredients complement each other and tantalize the taster. Of course, these little miniature cakes are also just beautiful to look at when you're finished. I noticed that coconut milk comes in 14 oz cans (you can find it in any Asian aisle of the market) so I just used 14 oz instead of 13.5. Results: fantastic.
