I'd give this 3 1/2 forks if I could. Marinated 7 lb. shoulder in the rub for 2 days, cooked for 4 hours at 325. It was very good-- the pork came out tender, with that great shredded consistency. I expected a little more flavor given the long cooking time and all the spices, chili and beer. Will probably use the technique again, may experiment with the flavors.

Very easy to make. I used orange juice instead of beer since that is what I had. Turned out great.

This was amazing! Incorporated the reviewers recommendation to cook down sauce afterwards - after skimming there wasn't much to cook down - mixed the shredded pork back into it. The pickled onions were a must! Would make this again in a heartbeat.

I made this for a dinner party and the guests raved. To begin, I went to 3 stores and could not find the chiles the recipe specified so I used what I could find. I did the rub a day ahead as the recipe suggests. There was a lot of delicious juice when I pulled the pot out of the oven so I took the pork out (I needed to shred it anyway) and skimmed the grease off the top and then reduced it on the stove top; then added the shredded pork back in the reduced sauce so it was perfectly coated and not runny. The pork was good as it was but with the reduced sauce it was really something special. I'm getting ready to make this for another party this weekend.

Made this recipe for 50 people. I used 20 lbs of pork shoulder. Followed recipe to letter (easily multiplies, given type of cooking). Do be sure to make the pickled onions and various salsas. The radishes are important also. One thing I did that might be of interest. Once the pork was done, I strained the liquid and reduced it by half. Then, on day of service, I used the reduction as part of the reheat. Guests were mighty impressed. On strength of this dish alone, I got another gig. Imperative you make with condiments. I do not suggest adjusting recipe.

this recipe is AMAZING! I'm from Chicago but live in Sydney now its hard to find the dried peppers. I used a can of chipolte peppers in adobo sauce instead and it packed a lot of heat. This has never failed to impress my aussie friends :)

Great recipe! I used a 2 pound pork butt with two anchos and 3 mild cayenne type chilies, 1 onion and 4 cloves of garlic. I cut the spices to haft the amount mentioned in the recipe. Came out great! Next time around, I'll probably bake the pork first to remove some of the fat, it is a very rich recipe. I served with guacamole and habanero salsa recipe on epicurious.

This was delicious. I used a little extra spice and the soaking liquid from the peppers instead of the beer (though I'm sure that's great too). I braised the pork in the oven for 4 hours at 250. Served with pickled onions, avocado, cheese and wheat/corn tortillas.

This pork was delicous! We had left overs and I couldn't stop nibbling it cold right out of the fridge.

I love this recipe! We only made the pork, since we live in a corn-tortilla-free country and had to make our own tortillas too, but it was absoutely fantastic and very, very easy as well. We marinated overnight and used a local dark beer, as well as a more mixed-up selection of chiles based on what we had around (chipotles, New Mexicos, and very very hot little Vietnamese chiles). Also, since we had time on our hands, we turned the oven way down and left the pot in for as long as possible. The meat was soft, juicy, flavorful, and as others have mentioned, just got better the following day. We used just radish, plain onions, cilantro and lime as a topping - no cheese. On the third day, we ate the last bits on arepas - also fantastic.

The best part about this recipe is that it just keeps getting better. Great way to cook once and eat well for several meals if you're not having a party. Made everything in this menu except the Micheladas and loved them all!!

These tacos were great. The pork on it's own was just alright, but combined with the salty Cotija cheese, fresh crunchy radish slices and pickled onions, the flavors were superb. I ladled off most of the fat that had cooked down and the pork was flavorful, tender and juicy. I work 45+ hours a week and managed to come home to this dinner cooking itself in the crock pot for company I wanted to impress. (They loved everything.) I also made the guacamole from this menu, the hibiscus agua fresca and the pinto beans. Everything was wonderful, simple, cheap ingredients and make-ahead friendly. Thanks for making me look like I slaved over this dinner all week!

We only made the meat and the pickled onions, but they were very good. I poured the remaining chile puree into the pot with the beer after I rubbed the pork. We used bottle salsa and topped with a little bit of cheese, lime juice, and sour cream. I tried them with both corn and flour tortillas, and really prefered them with the flour tortillas.

This is good, but not great. Maybe we are doing something wrong, but this was the second time we made it and we marinated in the rub over night, but it still seemed bland. We really like the idea of this dish, but we wanted a bit more kick and we were surprised we didn't get it from all the spices in this dish. Oh well. We decided to move on and hunt out something else for a great pork taco.

This was really delicious with wonderful flavor. Don't skip the sliced radishes and pickled red onions. Wasn't as crazy about the tomatillo chipotle salsa. My pork shoulder was 6 pounds and had a small bone in it. It took 3 hrs and 15 minutes.

The recipe was a huge hit. I rpasted 4 pablano peppers to go with the ancho chile peppers in the paste. It adds to the complexity with being too hot.

Easy to assemble. We used a crock pot instead of the oven and worked fine. We refrigerated the sauce to remove as much of the fat as possible prior to serving. Unfortunately, I can't say that there was anything special about this recipe. We have others, similar but more flavorful, that I would recommend over this one.

Good recipe. Under no circumstances throw away chile soaking liquid, tear up the chiles if you need to to cover; it's a good idea to hold back a little liquid; scrape the paste out of the blender, and add enough liquid to cover the blade, blend a few seconds- you'll get a LOT mre out. You may find that this many Anchos leads to a somewhat bitter dish.

powdered chiles are available and have been for years: chiles: ancho, pasilla; mulato, guajillo, etc. no need to do all that extra work--the end result is exactly the same. Time to edit the recipes for "la cocina mexicana"

This came out sooo tender and juicy! It braised in my oven for about 3.5 hours. I had Guiness in my fridge left over from St Patty's Day and used that instead and the pork was just so flavorful! I served this with corn tortillas, the pickled red onions and the tomato serrano salsa.

I'm always on the lookout for a good braising recipe, and this one's definitely going into heavy rotation. You really can't go wrong with this preparation. I used pastured chicken legs instead, and it was amazing. There's no doubt in my mind it'll be phenomenal with pork, too. Great in soft tacos, & leftovers over rice.

Really good. The chile paste gets infused into the meat while cooking. Yes, I can see how you you can vary the recipe in a lot of ways, but I think the way it is written is perfect. I served mine on a tortilla with a bit of plain greek yogurt, a mix of chopped jalapenos, onion, and lime juice, and a dash of Frank's hot sauce.

excellent recipe. I slow baked it for 3 hrs @ 300 degrees and it came out perfect.

This isn't a review of this 'exact' recipe, but more a suggestion on how adaptable it is. We used about a half dozen chicken thighs, a bottle of Corona, and a crock pot instead of braising. Everything else the same. Turned out fantastic.

I served it over a creamy polenta instead of as a taco and it was a huge hit at a dinner party over the weekend.

I'm not sure you can ruin this one. The initial prep of five minutes, followed by rub, then throw it to braise...didn't have to think about it, came out so tender after 3 hours. Could have put it on rice, whatever, not a lover of the corn tortillas. Did serve it with mashed potatoes with cheese and chipotle. Didn't have allspice, used a little cinnamon and ginger.

This make good tacos on Saturday but even better ones on Sunday. I will have them Monday for lunch too. I will add more spice next time for my taste. Might even do it in the smoker.

Wow! This was so good. Wonderful with pico de gallo and some thinly sliced red cabbage slaw. No modifications needed for this recipe. Great as is!

I've been making something similar to this for years now, and I'm very eager to try out the variations in this recipe. For the benefit of those who will complain "this isn't spicy enough" or "too bland": this is a recipe that demands that your spices be totalluy fresh. If you live near a Penzey's or similar spice store, buy fresh goods, seal them in opaque containers, and keep them in the freezer if possible. Buy whole allspice and cumin seeds, toast as much as you need for the recipe in a dry skillet, and grind them fresh. If you use that bottle of supermarket-bought ground allspice that's been sitting on your mother's spice rack for eleven years, you have no one but yourself to blame if the results are weak.
