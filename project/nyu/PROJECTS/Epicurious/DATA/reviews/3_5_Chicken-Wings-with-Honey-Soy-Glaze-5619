reduced soy sauce to 1/4 C and added water for rest. Also added cilantro and sesame seeds. This does NOT take 1 hr to cook. 20 min for my small chix wings. Then crisped them up under broiler. Very good. Will make again

These wings were absolutely delicious when I incorporated most of the suggestions from prior reviews: Instead of 1 c. soy sauce, I used 1/4 c. soy sauce and 3/4 c. water. I also doubled the honey to 6 tablespoons, omitted ginger (just didn't have it on hand), increased garlic to 3 tbsp, added a good amount of sriracha for heat, and used 1/2 c. rice wine vinegar instead of white distilled vinegar (again, just didn't have it on hand). I marinated 36 wings for the full 24 hours, roasted at 275 degrees for an hour and a half, basting every 20 minutes and turning twice. There was plenty of marinade, even for 36 wings. I used a rack with a disposable baking sheet and cleanup was a breeze. The wings were juicy and flavorful. I think the sriracha was really indispensable. Loved them and would definitely make them again! Might add a little more garlic, or try with the ginger next time.

I made these for a dinner party and didn't even get to eat one myself! They were a huge hit! I did end up adding more honey and garlic. Will definitely make again!

Added more garlic and honey as suggested. Also cooked at 350 for 1.25 hrs at 350, then kicked in the broiler for a few minutes as someone suggested to char it. The taste was just ok...mostly soy sauce tasting and I used a 1:1 mix of light soy and low sodium soy to try and cut back on the salt/soy taste. There has to be a better recipe for asian style wings...

I used the marinade on drumsticks and thighs. The chicken definitely benefits from chilling in the marinade overnight if you have the time. Very nice with side of white rice to soak up some of the extra sauce. Yum!

There are so few negative reviews listed, I wonder what I'm missing. Wings were just ordinary.

Rating: 3
I made this recipe for a crowd -- they loved it!! But... I found the marinade watery when cooking, about midway through the baking time I drained a lot of the marinade from the the tray. I set the oven at 325, and still had dark brown tips on the chicken. Be sure to turn the pieces from time to time. I will make these again. I was asked where I bought them (frozen) and my guests were knocked out when I told them I had made them myself from scratch.

Easy to make and tasty. My picky kids really liked them!

I agree with others who say that the wings were too salty and not sweet enough. And I'm a big fan of salt! I made it again the next day but used a 30-minute store bought honey teriyaki marinade (instead of soy and honey) but also included the garlic, onions and ginger. I cooked at 300 for an hour on nonstick foil then boiled the marinade and coated the wings again before plating. They turned out perfect!

Great recipe. Very flavorful and extremely easy to prepare. I sub'd 1/3 each low sodium soy, oyster sauce and water. Didn't have enough soy in pantry and read other reviews. I baked at 275 degrees for 1:45. Be sure to baste and flip a few times for even color. Will make again.

This was a great and extremely simple life saver. I cut the soy sauce in half and added sesame seeds. Marinated only two hours and it was just as delicious!

I should have read all of the reviews before I made this one! Didn't anyone else have these burn to a crisp when cooking at 400 degress for 1 hour?? I thought it was too hot and it looked like it was pretty done after 25 minutes. Should've trusted my gut. Otherwise, the sauce was good. I'll have to try it again but at a lower temperature or shorter time.

Made this recipe twice over the holidays for parties. Both times there were no leftovers and I've been asked for the recipe. I marinated the wings a full 24 hours and after cooking they were fall off the bone tender. I used low sodium soy sauce (1 cup) and added a little extra honey, some red pepper flakes and toasted sesame seeds. I also spiced up the dipping sauce by adding a little hot sauce. It was very good, a good crowd pleaser.

This is a very good receipe. The sauce is strong. But so are most Chinese sauces. Perfect with a bowl of rice.

Rating: 1
just so so. I did marinate overnight but there was just no "kick" to the flavor. Maybe something spicy would lift it up.

Rating: 3
Originally used 1 cup of soy sauce but after reading the reviews (re: too salty) I poured out half the sauce and added 1/2 cup of water and then 2 more tbs of honey. You would think living in China, I would be able to find low sodium soy sauce... but this isn't the case. Baked at 150C (300F) for 90 minutes and basted every 10 minutes. Still found it a bit salty. Will 1/4 cup of regular soy next time.

Rating: 2
I liked this recipe it was easy and it was a nice change for Super Bowl Sunday but it had no kick and it really needed more honey. Next time I make it I'll add more honey, some cilantro and some Vietnamese chili garlic sauce for a bit more zip.

Rating: 4
My suggestion is to substitute oyster sauce (3/4c) for the soy, which will help the reviewers with the excess salt problem. Also add a little chilli-garlic sauce in the marinade for kick. Excellent!

Cook from Upsy-Daisy, Thank you, sage. I was wondering how to combat that Miller Genuine Draft/San Fernando Valley taste that my husband finds so revolting. I can't believe I didn't think of using a watermelon-vinegar paste. Where was my head? I tried diced cigarette butts and melted lipstick. Thanks again for your wise advice.

This dish is way to salty, to the point where I was unable to eat the wings. I will not make this again. Great site though, I have enjoyed many of the other recipes available here.

IMPORTANT; if you don't want this to taste like Miller Genuine Draft and san fernando valley, douse the whole shebang in vinegar-watermelon paste. otherwise, use a soft beethoven sonata and some punks. ok?

Very easy to make. Super easy clean up time. You can also vary it for drumsticks or any chicken. I actually used split chicken breasts (with bone & skin). Still Very Good. The basting is what does it.

I really liked this recipe and I think it would've turned out better if I would've cut the cook time down by about 10-15 minutes.

I also reduced the amount of soy to 3/4 of a cup and increased the honey. Also added a quarter of a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the marinade and baked for one and a half hours at 300 degrees. These smelled great while cooking, and looked and tasted great when done.

Rating: 4
These were delicious! I also decreased the soy sauce and increased the honey, then cooked for about an hour and a half at 275. Very tender, sweet and a nice golden brown colour. I didn't even end up serving the sauce alongside, as the wings were so succulent they didn't need it. I will always do wings this way from now on.

I made this at a dinner party last week and these wings disappeared in less than 5 minutes. The children devoured them,5 lbs. of wings! I think each of the adults got maybe one. This is a super easy recipe to make,I increased honey to 5 or 6 tablespoons,and baked at 275 for an hour and forty-five minutes,I also sprinkled roasted sesame seeds over them,they looked pretty and the meat literally just fell off the bone,they were truly delectable.

I've tried many chicken wing recipes before and this one is by far the best! It tastes great and is very easy to make. You should line your pan for easy clean up.

Yum. The sesame seed oil is so good. The sauce smelled so wonderful, that I wanted to just go ahead and cook the chicken right away so I could taste it. Marinated for 24 hrs. Had a phone call, *slightly* burnt the sauce, and they were still wonderful! Will do wings this way every time.

To the cook from Ellicot City, MD..it does make a mess. Next time make more and make them in those inexpensive disposable bake pans you can pick up in just about any market. The guy who has to wash the dishes will be much happier!

It's crazy how quickly people gobbled these up. I actually had to tell one little girl to stop taking them, because she was stacking them on her plate and most people hadn't even gotten one yet. I only made 30! I fixed this recipe for a party along with about 6 others from this website and this one was definitely the biggest hit. My only problem was that the sauce made a big sticky solidified mess on the baking sheets. As the wings cooked, the liquids burned and crisped and turned into black substance that wouldn't come off. Even some of the wings started sticking to the sheet. Was it because of the honey or what? The guy who washed the dishes was really struggling... I felt bad. Any suggestions?

It was good, but I've had better. Used peanut sauce(G1/01) and this sauce for dipping

I agree with all of the rave reviews - every time that I make this recipe I have guests asking me to give them a copy of the recipe. I just finished cooking up two 5 lb. bags of wings marinated in this recipe - my guests ate every last one of them!! An absolute favorite of my three boys.

Rating: 2
These are not so "yummy" as previous reviews. Def cut back on the soy sauce, increase the honey, and reduce the amount of ginger. They did cook quickly in the oven, but over all they were not as I expected! I will keep in search of a different recipe.

Rating: 4
I made this for a cocktail party and all my guests descended on it like vultures! People thought I made them on the grill. I marinaded them for a full day, which I would definitely recommend. I also used less soy sauce and red chili pepper sesame oil to make them a little spicy. Also, you'll need to turn these often, as the marinade charred easily. Yum!

I made this appetizer for a New Year's party and everyone raved! So easy and so delicious. I have made chiken wings many times using several recipes. But I won't try another - this one tops all the rest!

Very flavorful glaze/marinade. I used thighs/legs (for dinner entree) rather than wings, increased the honey to 5 tbsp and marinated 5 hours. I think 400 degrees is too hot as the glaze has a tendency to char given all the honey, so I baked at 350 degrees for 1.25 hours basting often, then finished under the broiler for 2-3 minutes with good results. Chicken was moist and tender, had a lovely rich color, and just the right balance of sweet and spicy. Will certainly make again and think this would be a good marinade for pork chops and steaks as well.

I made these wings last night. I let them marinate for appx 12 hours before trying the 2hr slow roasting before the 1 hr cooking that another reviewer recommended. I made a large batch of the marinade--enough for 30 chicken wings, some boneless chicken breasts, and a flank steak. I ended up using an entire bottle of honey (the one that looks like a bear), a little less vinegar, and more fresh garlic and ginger. I also added about 2 tablespoons of ground ginger even after i added the fresh as well as some ground black pepper. Maybe it was the slow roasting, but the chicken was very tender...a little too tender for appetizer wings--like falling off the bone tender. I thought the wings were pretty tasty, but the didn't really go over that well. HOWEVER, the flank steak that I marinaded was gone immediately as well as the chicken. I will definitely use this marinade again for cooking. I may try to play around some with the wings, but the best part of this recipe isn't the meat!

Rating: 3
The only change I made was to add hot sesame oil since we like our wings spicy. It was tasty and certainly easy enough. I suggest using a glass pyrex lasgne-type dish for baking them, clean up is much easier.

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe. I probably doubled the honey. I cooked the wings for 2 1/2 hours on 250 then another hour at 400 degrees. This makes them very tender. I also basted about every 45 minutes.

I grilled chicken breasts using this recipe and they were absolutely delicious! And the aroma, mmmmmm. I would suggest using a bit more honey as the soy can overpower the more subtle ingredients.

Absolutely the best wing recipe EVER! DO NOT sub sugar for honey. The result is inferior! and DO NOT omit the sesame oil OR the FRESH ginger (powder WILL NOT DO). I also add an extra TBS Honey and about a TBS sesame seeds! The BEST ever.

Yummy. My husband gobbled these up and an Asian friend proclaimed them delicious. I substituted cider vinegar and had to use half white onions because I was out of scallions. It does make a lot of marinade so you could use more wings than it called for. I used those drummettes which are easier to eat. I also lined my pans with 2 pieces of foil (one wasn't wide enough) but they still leaked through to the pan and I had to soak them. Worth it, though.

This recipe is excellent. I also add extra green onions and honey. I marinade the wings overnight and then grill them on the BBQ. I've had many people ask me for this recipe.

Served these wings at a party and they were great! I doubled the marinade (using low-sodium soy sauce) and marinated 5# of chicken wings overnight. You want enough marinade to cover the wings while they marinate. I used a 2 gallon size ziplock bag and turned it over a few times to make sure all the wings were thoroughly marinated. With the help of a food processor it's an easy recipe.

Thanks to reviews from others I was able to make adjustment to the recipe so it wasn't too salty. I did this by cutting down on the amount of soy sauce, increasing the amount of honey and ginger.

This recipe was way too salty. The sweetness of the honey was not enough to cut the saltiness of the soy sauce. I also had a lot of marinde left over that just went down the drain. I would not make this recipe again!!

This recipe could have been a 3 forker except that it had called for too much sauce. I had used 3 lb of wings and ended up throwing alot of marinade down the sink. I also found that it was on the salty side. My family enjoyed the wings but I would not use it for company
