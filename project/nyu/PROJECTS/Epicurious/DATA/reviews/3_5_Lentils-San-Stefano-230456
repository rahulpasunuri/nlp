this was nice and easy. I happened to over cook my lentils and wanted to make something out of mushy lentils. So I sautéed the potatoes (with skins on), onions, garlic and also added carrots (I did use bacon fat). then I added them to my already cooked lentils, with some tomatoes I canned from my own garden last year and a little bit of chicken broth to thin it out a little. VERY good and easy...would make again.

Wanted something that reminded me of Ecuadorean lentil dish I grew up on. Variation.. ditch pork fat/bacon..use olive oil. No potato or bread, use 1 can petite diced tomato to save time, brown lentils easy to find in store, saute onion in olive oil until carmelized/toasty edges. Toss rest of ingredients in crock pot with extra garlic 4-5 hours on low. Serve on white rice with extra olive oil. Back to Ecuador...simple & understated. Subtle flavors. Comfort food.

I have made this many times. It's different than other lentil soups as the tomato's acidity balances the extreme earthiness of lentils.

I love lentils and I definitely enjoyed finishing my bowl filled with Lentils San Stefano.

I modified the recipe due to food restrictions - left out the potatoes and sugar, and added carrots, celery and leeks. Used San Marzano tomatoes and added fresh thyme, marjoram and rosemary as well. It is a hearty, well-balanced recipe that will definitely be a repeat in my kitchen. I didn't like lentils until now.

Thought this was delicious! Added some diced carrots and celery in with the onion to up the veggie quotient, and was probably a bit heavy with the spices. Used the bacon fat and the bacon was delicious crumbled on top but would have been delicious without. We toasted fresh homemade bread in bacon fat/olive oil as the recipe indicated, and that was by far the best part - saved some fat and did them right at the end so they were still warm. Of course, that was the least healthy part! Topped with a little fresh-grated parm cheese at the end, which also added a nice flavor. I'll definitely make this again!

Very tasty. I used olive oil instead of bacon fat so it was vegan. Doubled the oregeno and basil. Used a little less water. Delicious.

This is extraordinary! The flavors are subtle and delicious. I used a 28 ounce can of tomatoes and a cup of white wine instead of a 14 ounce can of tomatoes, and didn't add the extra 5 cups of water to the lentils. I also sauteed a small dice of carrots when cooking the potatoes. Served with a simple spinach salad with balsamic vinegar and olive oil it made a wonderful early fall rainy evening supper.

We LOVED this recipe though we didn't follow it to closely. I added baby bella mushrooms to the onions and garlic, white pepper and granulated garlic to the lentils while they were boiling/steeping,2 times the garlic the recipe called for, didn't use the pork fat/bacon at all just use oilve oil, half red lentils half whole (green) lentils, 3 bay leaves, and instead of the whole tomatoes in juice we used a can of extra hot rotel, and i added some broccoli leftover from dinner the night before when i added the potatoes and instead of the 5 cups of water I used 2 14 oz. cans of low fat low sodium chicken broth. It turned out great, although next time I won't use extra hot rotel just the regular will do b/c it was WAY too spicy for me but my bf loved it! To those who think it is bland just add more seasoning and more veggies and it will be very tasty! (but i also don't mind food that tastes healthy)

boring- I added some spice to the potatoes, and some leftover roasted apples and figs, and half cup beer among the three cups of liquid at the end. i'm glad, bc otherwise this would have been flavorless.

This was exceptionally good. Lots of great flavor. I don't know why one reviewer thought hers tasted like chili. I normally don't fix lentils, but decided I wanted some today. I had a ham bone and a little ham leftover to use up. I had just regular brown lentils. I took the ham bone and boiled that in 5 cups of water until the ham could be easily pulled from the bone. You don't want all the flavor of the ham to be boiled out of it. The water and ham and the leftover ham pieces (cut up) that I had I used in the final step. I cooked my lentils as written. Cooked the potatoes and onions as written, except I only cooked them in a little olive oil, not bacon or pork fat. . I didn't use garlic because I'm allergic to it. I did use one really large onion. I followed the recipe throwing everything in the pot as directed in the recipe. I did use crushed tomatoes instead of whole ones. I used freeze dried oregano and basil as I don't yet have fresh available in my garden. I put the herbs in just before the lentils were done. Then I left it to simmer for about an hour, longer. Just barely simmering. More like on warm to keep the herb flavors in. This was a knock out supper. Will definitely make again.

this was tastey in a pinch, but i would have preferred something with more flavor. not a bad use for lentils, but i've encountered better.

this tasted like a bland version of chili. I did not care for it

simple and satisfying, although this is basically a veggie dish, the pork (I used leftover pork fat) makes it seem very hearty.

I found this recipe to be marvelous. My husband is not a lentil fan, but he requested this again! I substituted French green lentils since that was easier to find, and it worked great.
