OMG! This frosting is AMAZING! I have not frosted the cake - thought the batter tasted YUMMY! I hope there is enough frosting left for the cake!!! I may make this just as a sweet snack in the fridge... I made cake and frosting and both are wrapped and ready for assembly tomorrow for Mother's Day. Recipe reminds me of a cake my grandmother would have made, so I thought it was an ideal choice for Mother's day. Hope it's a hit!

This is a fabulous, easy, made-from-scratch cake, but needs 3 8-9" pans, lots of batter. The icing is to die for but it needs another 1/2 box of xxx sugar to stiffen up. The only negative is that the spices are quite heavy and you will lose any sign of the blackberry jam, so maybe you could lighten up on the spices, about 1/2 the amount might do it. I have never learned how to open an oven door while baking a cake, so I skipped that step without any damage, but I do have a newer oven. Yum, yum

Made this last night. There was so much batter, I used 3 cake pans, not 2. I recommend leaving out the strong spices - cardomon, cloves. They overpower this cake. It's really just another spice cake - and what's the point of using blackberry jam if you can't taste it? It wasn't very moist,either, and the recipe was long and complicated and expensive (6 eggs! why??) Won't make it again,or maybe I'll try a different version.

no no no no no. My recipe calls for three cups of white sugar. 1 cup of butter, 1 cup of buttermilk, 2 tbsp. of karo syrup, and 1 tsp. of baking soda. Over medium heat, cook untl it reaches soft ball stage. then put it into a glass bowl and with a mixer, mix it for seven minutes or until it reaches spreading consistency. This is much much better. E-mail me if you want the whole recipe

I haven't made this cake, but reading the reviews I thought I'd mention a much better version- if an old fashioned jam cake is what you're after, try the excellent Tennessee jam cake with caramel frosting in The Cake Mix Doctor cookbook by Anne Byrn. Easy and delicious.

I found this cake was way too much work for nothing special. I agree with some of the other reviewers. There was way too much icing, and if you use it all, the cake is too rich to eat. My family left blobs of icing on their plates. Also, the icing must set up A LOT or it will cause your cake to slip away. The cardamom in the recipe was too much spice, and the blackberry jam added no special flavor.

I had this cake last night as a dinner guest and loved it- I had seconds!

Comments: Icing should come with warning to ice cake in 5 seconds and get the thing back into the fridge or it will go slip sliding away. Also, enough goo to ice two cakes. Also, you couldn't taste the blackberry jam at all. It was totally dominated by the spices. Ought to just buy a Duncan Hines spice cake mix and a canned frosting.

In response to an earlier comment, the icing did seem strange at first but was excellent once on the cake. I agree the recipe did make way too much icing.

This cake didn't taste very good and had a somewhat scary consistency.

I disagree with the comment on the icing. I thought it was delicious, even when eaten by itself. (Yes, I did.) I found that the recipe made way too much icing -- I don't know how you could possibly use it all.

I made this cake for a football tailgate and it was very well received. The icing on this cake is strange tasting when first made, but tastes very good when the cake is assembled. Be sure to let the icing set up to a very thick consistency before icing or the layers will slide. This is a cake that is very easy to make and will taste much better on the second or third day after making.
