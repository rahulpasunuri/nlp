Couldn't be easier, especially if you can make the sauce ahead of time; I love recipes where veggies and main can be cooked at the same time in the oven. Also love that kids can eat without the tahini if they prefer, while the sauce makes it more unusual & tastier for parents. A good way of cooking chicken breasts--perfectly juicy and FAST.

This was a really easy dinner.. I took the advice of others and doubled the garlic and lemon juice-excellent! I loved the tahini sauce with the asparagus especially. I will definately make this again!

Added more garlic (3 gloves) and 2x the amount of lemon, which gave the sauce more flavor. I served it with couscous, which was a nice compliment to the dish.

Simple, quick and delicious. I omitted the sugar from the tahini sauce mixture, but otherwise followed the recipe. I think this would be great with the chicken cubed and served over whole wheat pasta.

This is a quick way to prepare both chicken and asparagus. It was good even without the tahini sauce. I'll use less salt the next time I make this recipe. I think it calls for too much salt overall, and I advise skipping it for the tahini sauce.

I like this recipe- no, it's not terribly elaborate but it's still very good...I make it fairly regularly for a nice weeknight meal. Aside from agreeing to add more garlic and lemon juice and not bothering to put the chicken in the oven, I also don't deal with the hassle of pureeing the dressing in the blender- a bowl and vigorous whisking is just great.

The recipe was good, but the chicken was a bit bland... I must say though that the Tahini sauce was delicious on the asparagus. I did add quite a bit more garlic then they called for.

Easy and good. Will make again.

My first post - I sent this recipe to all my friends. Other than the cooking time in the oven, which I assume was a typo (mine was ready after 15 minutes, not 5), I made this as written and my family LOVED it. It's a great weekday, rushing-out-to-baseball, kind of meal.

Easy to make - the chicken was moist and tender - kids loved it.

Much too hard- it used too many pots, pans, baking sheets, bowls, etc. The sauce was extremely garlicy. It tasted pretty good, but the chicken took much longer than the recipe said in the oven- and frequently checking chicken (in a skillet) in a 450-degree oven can heat you up pretty quickly. Not something I'd make during a weeknight, for sure.

I agree with Chicago. This is a good weeknight recipe for tahini lovers and the recipe benefits from more lemon and garlic. But what is up with the cook from Reno who substituted peanut butter, then had the sensibility (or lack of) to write that she didn't like it? Really??? DAH!!!!! I get so annoyed when people completely change a recipe - then write negative comments about the recipe. WHY EVEN BOTHER????

I agree with previous comments about omitting the sugar. I would consider adding a pinch of salt, also, and increasing the garlic. A quick, easy dinner to prepare -- and I was in a rush the night I made it!

I love tahini and this was pretty quick and simple. I took the suggestion of upping the amount of lemon juice and garlic; I was pleased with the way the sauce worked with the chicken, but not with the asparagus, which I felt it overwhelmed. Not a big deal though. Also, I think part of the problem may have been that I didn't thin my sauce enough. Overall, a good recipe and one that I would definitely make again.

I thought this was a good, easy mid-week dinner. I took the previous poster's advice and increased the lemon juice and garlic and dropped the sugar. Served with the asparagus and garlic/pine nut couscous.

I've been making this for years but when thinning the tahini, and peanutbutter is not a substitute,the flavors are so different from each other;I use at least a 1/4 cup lemon juice,three of four cloves of garlic and 1-2 Tbsp of water. This also makes an excellant salad dressing. Just keep thinning with lemon juice to desired consistency.

I mean...it was ok, but nothing special...easy for a mid-week dinner. I used peanut butter instead of Tahini, and if you're thinking that is why I didn't like it, well, you may be on to something....but I think it was because there was nothing else to the apsaragus and chicken, but oil, and s/p. Borsville!! I'd use the sauce again, maybe for wraps or flatbread pizza, but not htis combo again.
