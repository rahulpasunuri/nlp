I make this recipe constantly. I ususually add an extra small avacado to thicken.

I have had more luck with the canned, pureed tomatillos that you can find in the latin food section of the grocery store. I buy goya, and using it has really made this recipe a lot easier. I sometimes add a bit more avocado & sour cream to thicken it. I also add a bit of lime zest. It's always a hit!

Have made this several times - always with good results. Note to the cook who's salsa turned out bitter - it may well have been the tomatillos; they have to be ripe and cooked through. I sometimes leave out the sour cream and use as a salsa with other things - goes well with pork cutlets.

I have made this dip several times--so yummy with the new Baked Tostitos! We also use it as a sandwich spread. I also recommend using canned tomatillos for an easier version--I even throw in an extra avocado at the end diced in chunks. Very addictive!

I have made this dip several times. I use it as a dip for quesadillas and have also used it as an "aioli" for grilled tri-tip sandwiches. Leave some of the jalapeno seeds in to spice it up a bit. Super easy. In a pinch I use canned tomatillos (no need to cook) and it turns out great and can be done in about5 minutes!

I've made this dip many times...much to the delight of my friends and family. They request it over and over again. It's a breeze to make and everyone always thinks I put more time into than I really did!

I wasn't impressed with this dip at all! There was a decidedly bitter taste to it.
