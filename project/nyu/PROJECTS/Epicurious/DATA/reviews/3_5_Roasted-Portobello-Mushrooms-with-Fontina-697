This has become one of my favorite recipes and makes a great light vegetarian summer entree when paired with a salad. However, it should be noted that we at least triple the amount of garlic and herbs called for in the recipe and season with lots of freshly ground salt and pepper. We also use thick slices of chewy whole wheat bread from the farmer's market, which adds a nice nuttiness. This is a good simple recipe to highlight quality ingredients.

I often makes these with flavored olive oils leaving out the fresh herbs. Always turn out great!

I just made this without the bread, so I could have it on my Atkins diet. I added some pine nuts and left the mushrooms whole. I ended up with an ocean of water on my plate. I'm sure the recipe as written is better; maybe slicing the shrooms lets some of the flood out.

We serve this every year while on Spring Break in Florida. We serve it with Shrimp with Sicy Creole Sauce. We are going on our 5th year of this tradition. It is a MUST!!

Simple and delicious...I grilled the mushrooms and toasted the bread before I put the mushrooms and cheese on and rubbed the outside with garlic.

I made this recipe for a wine tasting. It was the first appetizer to be eaten. The flavor was very good. I used both fontina cheese and did some with guyere. I preferred the fontina. I would recommend that the thinner you slice the bread, the better the overall flavor. I also prepared the mushrooms 4 hours in advance without any real loss of flavor.

My husband and I like portobello mushrooms and this was a great receipe with a salad.

I loved this recipe, the portobellos were nice and meaty. I added pickled onions and I think gruyere is a better match than fontina. Everything else was great, I can't wait to have this again!

I'm torn. I enjoyed the flavor, but it wasn't worth all the work. So, I gave it a two, yet said I would make it again (I'd eat it if someone else cooked it). Tasty, however you can find other dishes on this site that are more flavorful but require the same amount of work or less.

I can't say I agree with all the previous reviewers. Maybe I did something wrong, but I found these to be very average. They just tasted like big plain mushrooms on bread with cheese. In fact I think that is what you should rename this recipe! I just don't seem to get all the fuss.

Fontina cheese wasn't available when I prepared this recipe, so I used Gruyere on two mushrooms and Irish Dubliner on the two. Served with minestrone soup and homemade pasta, these were a highlight - both were delicious. These make a great accompaniment for soup - we've had them with our weekday lunch soup. A real keeper.

Great appetizer...I prepared the mushrooms earlier in the day and refrigerated until ready to assemble and bake. Everyone loved them!

This was delicious. I had never used fontina cheese before and enjoyed the favor in this great appetizer. It would be a nice compliment to a simple soup dinner.

Oh my.... I can see one of the previous reviewers, placing the mushroom topped bread in the oven and waiting for the cheese to melt on the counter.... Puhlease!

This was a great appetizer!

The directions are incomplete. The recipe does not tell me to put the cheese on the mushrooms before baking. However, the cheese must be on the mushrooms if it is to be checked for melting.
