I peel the tomatoes after roasting before putting them in the pot. I also add all the accumulated juices from the roasting pan. This time, I added a touch of white wine to the onions at the end of cooking and let that reduce to add another depth of flavor. I use about 6 cloves of garlic when roasting the tomatoes.

Loved this soup. We added cooked orzo at the end to give it a wonderful texture (to mimic a Cafe Zupa's favorite -- local restaurant). We paired it with a ham, muenster cheese panini. Yummy! Will keep this in my favorites file.

Wonderful recipe with loads of flavor--made it for my husband and two potlucks in one week. Rave reviews from all! I increased the garlic and let the onions cook a bit longer. Don't be tempted to skip the straining- it doesn't take much time and the result is very silky and delicious. The stuff that comes out is mostly hard shreds of tomato skin, which you don't want in there.

I quadrupled this recipe, for a luncheon for 35 people. It was time consuming considering the amount of tomatoes but well worth it. Only 2 cups left over. I substituted basil instead of oregano. I used plum tomatoes, and found some of the amount I needed on the reduced rack at the grocery store. Rave reviews from everyone!

Excellent and easy. I didn't strain it and it was incredibly smooth. I did make the wafers, but wished I'd made them closer to bite size vs the large disc -- it's difficult break-up.

Fantastic soup. I make this regularly. I use skim lactose reduced milk instead of cream and like others, use an immersion blender. I do not strain it. The one thing I do add is an entire bunch of fresh basil after I puree the soup, then I puree it again to chop up the basil.

My family's favorite! I have made this many times. I added half and half, but would use whole milk next time. I use a food mill to sieve, but might try a sieve next time. (although a food mill speeds up the process).

Very good tomato soup--used fresh plum tomaotes for a great flavour. Used a hand blender to puree but I did sieve the soup because I found the seeds bitter. With the parmesan wafers it was a big hit at two dinner parties over the past week

This is a nice soup to start a dinner that is on the rich side. I doesn't have a ton of cream, but it has a lot of flavor. I made the soup the day before and then heated it up with the cream just before serving. I did not push it through a sieve. Wait. That's a lie. I tried to push it though my strainer and ended up with something that shouldn't be served. SO, I blended what didn't go through the sieve until it was super duper blended and put it back in with the rest. I was worried , but it turned out great!

This soup is delicious!!!! Even people who said they never eat soup loved it. I used a stick blender to puree, and it is a very easy soup to make. In later ocasions, I was too lazy to pass it though a sieve. So I just served it like that without the cream and with normal croutons. EVERYBODY loved it!!!!! thanks.

This is really a delicious tomato soup recipe! Being a health conscious vegetarian and loving spicy food, I made a couple of modifications. I used low sodium vegetable broth in lieu of the chicken stock. Plus, I used some fresh spicy oregano (about 4 tablesppons) and one tablespoon of thai basil. These additions really kicked up the flavor. Finally, I started to strain the soup but realized the hearty texture created from the puree was much more of a compliment to the soup. Finally, I don't think the cream or the parmesan wafers are needed. I skipped on both and still had a fantastic and more healthy soup. Try it out!

I followed the recipe almost exactly except, I didn't strain it, I added 1/4 cup of chopped basil, and I didn't make the Parmesan wafers. The soup was wonderful. We made grilled cheese sandwiches as well!

This really is an exceptional soup. I followed the recipe pretty closely, skipping only the straining step. I did let everything cook a bit longer than suggested. Roasting the tomatoes and garlic almost 1 1/2 hours. Cooking the onions twice as long and simmering the whole thing closer to 45 minutes before pureeing. I actually made this for a dinner party for tomorrow, but the kids (4 yr, 12 yr and 42 yr) have pounced and it is looking like there won't be anything left tomorrow! :)

Great way to use up all those summer tomatoes. I used all yellow tomatoes and shallots instead of onions, no cream and cut down on the amount of stock by 1/3. Result was sweet, creamy and silky soup. So easy!

Amazing. Most of the reiews I have read have ommited the straining step. While I agree that there is no need for it, there is also no need for the parmesean wafers....or to bother making your own soup when you go buy a can of Cambells. I strain it twice, first with a fine mesh sieve, then with a Chinese Tea Strainer...which takes a long time. But the finished product is sublime. The texture is that of a consume, if silk were a liquid, this is what it would feel like in your mouth. Try taking the time to see what happens when you strain it.....its worth every minute.

We make this almost once a week in the wintertime, which in Seattle, lasts a while. I've never made it with fresh tomatoes though! Always used 3 cans of whole tomatoes, my favorite is San Marzano sp?. I rarely put in cream, never missed it so stopped doing it. I use a hand blender and have never strained it. This is an easy week-night meal for us. We've also never made the wafers. We eat it with grilled rosemary ham and cheese sandwiches and oooh and aaahh the entire meal! With a 4 and an 8 year old! Use more oregano!

my husband and i loved this soup. i didn't bother putting it through the sieve - it was very smooth without the extra work of straining. i can't wait to try it over the summer with in season tomatoes. i think you could omit the cream if you wanted to cut some calories and it would still be delicious. roasting the tomatoes and garlic give it such a hearty flavor. excellent!

This is pure comfort on a rainy day. For a recent dinner party, I didn't strain it, didn't add cream or use the parmesan wafers when I had a fresh, crusty boule on hand. I did garnish each individual bowl with a sprig of fresh basil, and put a bowl of pesto on the table to stir in for extra flavor. My guests raved.

This was an absolutely piquant soup. I omitted the parmesan wafers due to time constraints. Instead I crumbled parmesan cheese on top and garnished with the last of the basil leaves from our garden.

This soup was a big hit...i used a 1/4 cup of cream and skipped the straining. I added basil before blending, fresh thyme sprigs for the roasting and some more in the onions. it was great, rich and the tomato flavor was excellent, it was devoured amid much fanfare!! i skipped the wafers but garnished with ribboned basil instead. i used fresh sweet small tomatoes...this is a real keeper!

Well, everyone I served this to liked it much more than I did. I thought it was good, but others really liked it. I do think that the parmesean wafer makes it, so I would recommend including it. I pureed this in a high-speed blender, which almost negated the need for straining because everything was pulverized. So, you may or may not need to strain, depending on the blender. This was a pretty thick soup for me--not sure why others thought it wasn't.

Delicious, concur with leaving out the straining step. Serve chilled.

This soup was perfect for the first course of my Thanksgiving dinner. I used tomatoes from my garden. My husband and guests were thrilled with it. I agree with the reviewer about the parmesean wafters, the presentation is lacking with them. I'll try the suggestion to crumble them next time to get the flavor. Definitely a keeper, thank you!

My family really liked this soup and I will absolutely make it again. I made a couple of adjustments. First, I used fresh oregano instead of dried. I also added a handful of chopped fresh basil after pureeing. Like another reviewer, I skipped the straining. The result was a wonderful soup with a nice consistency. I also agree that it gets better after a day or two in the fridge. I served this soup with grilled gouda cheese and apple sandwiches on French bread. Yummy Sunday night supper!

Rating: 3
I have to say, I didn't really come to enjoy this soup until the third day (when it was almost gone) because it took that long for the flavor to fully develop. Perhaps I was mistaken in expecting a creamy soup (it was really thin) or perhaps my sieve was too fine (it took forever to strain); either way, next time I will probably add some bread to the mixture while it simmers to give it a more hearty texture, and I will use a different sieve so it takes the seeds out but not all of the pulp. Overall it's a nice soup, but I'll probably try a tomato bisque recipe next time, at least during these cold winter months.

My 77 yr old mom thought it was too thick, but she eats Campbell's tomato soup. Everyone else thought it was perfect!

Three and a half forks. Easy to make and delicious, especially with a good grilled cheese sandwich.

My girlfriend brought home a bunch of tomatoes from a friend's garden and said, "You can make something with these, right?" Thanks to this recipe, I sure could! This soup was delicious with grilled cheese sandwiches. Rich (even without cream, used 2% milk instead) tomato taste with a bit of a bite to it. It was very satisfying to make because it filled the kitchen with an amazing aroma of garlic and tomatoes. I didn't bother forcing the soup through a sieve as it came out pretty smooth after a few zaps of the immersion blender. The slightly chunky texture was part of its appeal, anyway. The girl loved it and I will definitely be making it again once the cold weather hits.

In addition to being a great tasting soup, roasting the tomatoes and garlic in the oven for an hour makes the house smell SO good! Like other reviewers, I used milk instead of cream, and I saw no need to force through a sieve.

This soup was lovely - very flavorful and satisfying. It would almost be worth making just for the wonderful aroma in my kitchen of roasting tomatoes and garlic. I didn't do the step where you force the puree through a sieve - skip the time and mess and have a soup that has a more rustic texture! Like many other reviewers, I didn't make the parmesan wafers - I served this soup with the broccoli rabe and provolone panini also on this site, and it was a delicious pairing.

Like all good soups, this one tastes better many hours, or even a day, after it is made. This boasts hearty, earthy flavors of roasted tomatoes and roasted garlic (which I admittedly used more than recommended). Very well received, by adults and children alike. not overly time consuming...for a soup. Definitely worth trying at least once. I will make this again.

THE SOUP WAS OUTSTANDING - WE PUT A DALOP OF CREME FRAICHE IN THE SOUP ON TOP OF THE WAFER CRIP. I PURCHASED THE ALREADY MADE THE KITCHEN TABLE BAKERS ALL PARMESAN GOURMET WAFER CRISPS AND LET MY GUESTS CHOOSE WHICH OF THE EIGHT FLAVORS OF THE KITCHEN TABLE BAKERS ALL PARMESAN CRISPS THEY DESIRED. THIS WAS THE BEST PART OF THE MEAL.

This was so good! I omitted the cream because I was in the mood for a clean tasting soup rather than a rich creamy soup. I think another time, I might try it with the cream. I also didn't strain it because I blended it for a long time and it just didn't need it. March tomatoes just aren't that flavorful so I added a splash of red wine vinegar and a little more sugar for brightness. The result of those changes was a refreshing and rustic soup that was still elegant. Then, I served it with glorified grilled cheeses with sage, apples and red onion. A grown up version of a kid's favorite!

This has got to be one of the best recipes i've tried on epicurious. i used milk instead of cream this time for a lower calorie option, and the taste wasn't compromised a bit. i also put in some fresh basil when i added the tomatoes. one of the few recipes i don't feel the need to modify though, it's delicious just as it's printed!

This a true tomato lovers soup! I used a combination of roma tomatoes and Early Girl tomatoes from my farmers market.

Made according to recipe, but instead of cream and instead of parmesan wafers, I added a rind from a wedge of parmesan (you can store these in the freezer) and let it simmer with the tomatoes, then removed it before serving. Gave it a divine, parmesan-y rich flavor.

It's really a three-and-a-half forker. When tomatoes are good, the perfect soup just lets them be, and this one does a great job of that. I use fresh oregano, fresh purple garlic, and a mixture of heirloom tomatoes. Try it with brandywines, federles, garden peaches, marmandes, black crimeans, and soldackis-- great sweetness, savor, wininess, and depth of flavor-- and support good taste and biodiversity!

Even though it's summertime and over 100 degrees where I live, I was craving some homemade tomato soup and found this recipe in my Best of Gourmet: Flavors of Rome cookbook - It is *wonderful*!!!

This is a wonderful, intensely flavorful soup. The roasted garlic adds a level of richness that most tomato soups don't reach. I halved the cream and used a food mill to puree the tomatoes (no need to strain!)

Every winter, my husband requests this recipe. I think this is the third year I've made this. It is easy and delicious.

Loved this recipe, and such little work for a great taste. Tastes much richer than 1/2 cup of cream (divided among 8 bowls) would have you think. I added fresh basil to give it some depth and I would only sugar to taste as my tomatoes were a bit on the sweet side and I didn't need any extra. I also added a dash of red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick. Even though I ran the pureed soup through a sieve to serve to guests, I made it for just me and my boyfriend one night and omitted that step. I liked the soup even better then, as it seemed heartier.

This was an excellent soup! I used fresh garden tomatoes (not plum) and roasted for 2 hrs. at a lower temp with extra garlic. I used no sugar at all because my tomatoes were sweet. Don't be fooled.... it may look liked "canned tomato soup", but it tastes like an infusion from Tuscany! The rich, roasted flavors are ever so evident!

Sorry this one just didn't didn't do it for me. I used home grown roma tomatoes and they were delicious after roasting but I felt the soup ended up being too sweet without much flavor. I agree with the poster suggesting some basil & I would only add the sugar to taste (since another poster used more sugar). I would not bother with the food mill & would have peeled the tomato with the garlic (I just pulled out whatever skins were floating and used my immersion blender until it was smooth. Good but not great, next time I would just roast the tomato & garlic, chop it & toss with some pasta & basil.

I changed the recipe slightly, so I won't give a fork rating--I was preparing it for a vegetarian so I used high-quality vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. The soup was good in the end, but I had to doctor it a lot--it just wasn't very full-flavored and needed more sugar (I used some honey too), a lot of salt and some balsamic vinegar to taste right. I definitely used all the cream. Fresh basil would have improved it quite a bit, but I didn't have any. I guess my tomatoes were inferior, but they are not out of season. I think a slower, lower roast might help. By the way, the skins slipped right off the tomatoes after simmering, so I discarded them and didn't bother seiving. The texture was good. I doubt I'd try this again, as four pounds of tomatoes can be kind of pricy, even in summer. I've had better luck slow-roasting good canned tomatoes.

We enjoyed this recipe very much and only modified it by adding more garlic and less sugar. I also sprinkled the tomatoes with both sugar and salt as I felt it would help carmelize them, but they need to be watched so they don't burn. I pureed it but didn't put through a sieve or food mill and added a can of tomato chunks at the end to give even more texture. It was more like a blend between soup and a stew and the flavor was terrific.

YUM!! This is one of those great cold winter day soups, and despite having a long preparation time is not hard to make (the long time is from cooking the tomatoes for an hour). We followed the recipe but instead of sieving the soup at the end we left it as it was. It was hearty and full of great flavour. The second time I made it, I cooked the tomatoes too long, and they had blackened areas - this made the soup darker in colour, and tasted a bit burned. To 'save' it, I added a can of tomatoes in puree, some more cream, and a heap of basil. It was just OK - word of caution, watch the tomatoes!!!

This soup is good, maybe even really good. But, after waiting for it for 2 hours, it is still tomato soup. It isn't really worth waiting for, unless you are going to be in the house for other purposes. If I make it again, will make a day in advance. Perhaps will truly appreciate it at that point.

This is a delicious and easy soup to make, and a great way to use up all those late tomatoes. I'm not a fan of sweetened tomato dishes, but the little bit of sugar in this recipe was just right. I only added a small amount of half and half instead of cream to keep the calories down.

To all the soup-scalded cooks out there. I learned a trick in culinary school years ago. When blending hot liquids, take the stopper out of the top of the blender, and place a dish cloth loosely over the hole. Then just "pulse" it a few times 1st. All that pressureized steam needs to escape in a controlled manner. Also, blend in small batches. Saves injury and clean up time.

Yes, my Waring blender spewed hot soup, too. Next time I'll fill the blender less than 1/2 before flipping the switch. Used Roma tomatoes. This soup is terrific. To save time, I placed store-bought fresh cheese toasts in the soup instead of the Parmesan wafers - everyone raved just the same.

This is so delicious. I've made it twice, and the second time I used vegetable stock since I was making it for a vegetarian friend. It was just as good as when I used chicken stock. I didn't make the parm wafers, but instead threw together an herbed cheddar cheese and beer quick bread, which was fabulous and great for dipping in the soup. Will make it again very soon and double the recipe, as everyone loves it and keeps asking for more!

It was pretty good - followed the recipe with the exception of a hand blender vs regular blender. It doesn't yield a lot of soup once you sieve but it seemed important for the texture. The parmesan wafers made it for me. I just made one big wafer in a non-stick skillet - cooked it over medium for 4-5 mins, flipped it and cooked it 4 mins or so longer. Then just broke it into pieces to serve.

Am I the only idiot who had a blender escapade trying to puree the hot soup?! Needless to say, the remaining soup that did not splatter all over my kitchen due to my error was yummy--I didn't sieve it all and baked the parmesan wafers on a pizza stone and they turned out fine. The wafers made the soup, I think.

Rating: 4
This is fabulous soup. All my tasters agree. Sieving is nice because the texture is so velvety once the cream is added. The third time I made it, I sprinkled the tomatoes with oregano and rosemary before roasting, a lovely addition. But it was good to strain the pokey rosemary out before serving.

EXPERIMENTS not to perform with this recipe: DON'T use green tomatoes. My family loves fried green tomatoes, so when my mother had to pull a two-pound crop of green cherry tomatoes before the freeze, I thought, "what better way to use them?" The result was so sour and acidic that merely licking the spoon turned my stomach. Keep green tomatoes for frying ONLY - and in much larger form. I WILL try this again, but with good, honest plum tomatoes. Maybe in a few weeks. Or a few months...

I loved this recipe. It has very rich flavors and a wonderful aroma. Based on previous comments, I seived about 3/4 of it so it would have some consistency. I would only add the cream if I were serving as a first course, in which case, I would strain the whole thing. This is a great soup that I know I'll keep making over and over again!

I have made this a few times and never strained the tomatoes--I do puree the soup. MUST SERVE WITH SOME CROUTON.

My boyfriend said it tasted more like a sauce than a soup, and a friend said it tasted like pizza, but I loved it. And they did too after a few more tastes. It was easy and interesting, it has a nice kick to it. I didn't strain out the seeds or anything - just processed as is and it was great. Definitely don't need the cream - you could use milk and it would be great too.

I thought this dish was fairly good -- I might try another kind of tomatos next time, because I thought the soup could use some more tomato flavor....it was pretty good though. However you HAVE to strain it -- i took a sip before putting it through the sieve and all the skins were just icky -- once i strained it, it was much better.

I have made this recipe twice and both times my family has loved it. The second time I served it I used purchased "seasoned" crutons instead of making the Parmesan Wafers -- my family actually preferred that version so I'll skip the Parmesan Wafers in the future. Definitely delicious.

I made this a few weeks ago and absolutely loved it. My husband used to hate soup, then he got interested in cream soups. He wasn't sure if he would like it, but tried it anyway. He thought it was outstanding. The parm wafers were ok, but not as great as I would have hoped. It does add to the presentation, as does adding tiny basil leaves just before serving.

This soup is wonderful! I just finished making it & am enjoying a bowl as I type. I didn't find this the least bit labour intensive; in fact, one of the reasons I tried this recipe is because it seemed so simple. My father-in-law doesn't like my cooking at all, but I'm going to be serving him this soup to see if I can win him over!

This tomato soup is nothing special and the parmesan wafers, which had an odor of dirty socks, made it worse. Try the Black Bean and Roasted Tomato Soup on this site(which I make with white beans) for a great tomato soup.

very good soup. almost as good as an old new england recipe i have for tomato bisque, only much easier. less steps. will definitely make again.

Rating: 3
This was excellent, and well worth the work. I roasted the tomatoes and garlic the night before. I also added a little wine and a bit more chicken broth. I like my soup a little thinner. I didn't bother with the straining, as I am lazy and didn't have a fine enough sieve. Threw some good quality parm and black pepper on top, but I like the suggestion of the croutons from another reviewer. Will try that next time. And there definitely will be a next time.

Rating: 4
I am commenting as a former tomato soup hater! This is an incredible soup. The only addition I made was to add red pepper flakes when sauteeing the onion. I also followed another reviewers idea in toasting bread with oil and oregano and then adding shaved parmesan and cutting into crouton size pieces. I can't wait to make it again and again and again. It is that GOOD!

Rating: 4
This is a great soup, always gets great compliments! I use dried basil and tarragon instead of oregano. It's easier to use a hand blender, and I think it's worth it to strain the soup. Also very easy to make ahead.

This soup required a lot of steps and a lot of time and turned out fairly bland and unexciting. Defintely not worth the trouble.

What a great use for all the tomatos my garden produced this year!! The only troublesome part was that I tried straining the puree through a conical strainer that has a very fine mesh. It resulted in a very fine, creamy soup, but was A LOT of effort. Next time I'll opt for a larger mesh strainer. Nevertheless, this was delicious.

Although this soup had a very nice flavor, it too closely resembled tomato sauce - as in the kind you would use with pasta.

I followed the recipe exactly and was very disappointed. Based on all of the previous reviews, I guess I just expected something more but it's just a basic tomato soup.

To the last reviewer, I think you used cherry tomatoes instead of plum tomatoes, which, I believe, are the same as Roma tomatoes. Romas are oval shaped instead of round and much bigger than cherry tomatoes.

Rating: 3
Great and easy. Got rave reviews from my friends. Question - I bought plum tomatoes as the recipe called for but are plum tomatoes always tiny or do they come in larger sizes? It took me forever to cut 4 pounds of dime size tomatoes. The soup was so good, I'd do it again but would like a little guidance on the tomatoes.

Great soup and flavor overall. Probably will use a little less garlic next time I make it.

Excellent! Served it with basil cream (bring cup of cream to the boil, add handful of basil leaves till wilted and blend).

I made the nonGourmet version. ;) I was making this only for myself, and to freeze, so I omitted the blender step and instead removed the tomato peels before adding them to the soup. Then I used a wire whisk to help break them down during the simmer phase. The soup tasted wonderful even before the addition of the cream and is truly decadent with the cream. I haven't made the wafers and plan instead to sprinkle fresh parm on top of the bowl. Yum!

Rating: 3
This soup is wonderful. I had frozen some roma tomatoes from my garden this summer, because we had so many. I was skeptical how fresh they would taste in this soup, but I thawed them and roasted with lots of garlic. Did not strain soup or add the cream, and it was great. I too, grilled sandwiches with provolone cheese and ham. Wonderful dinner on a weeknight. This soup is quick and easy and in no way should only be saved for "intimate dinner parties".

I made this soup during the summer when I had lots of tomatoes. Loved it. I froze some to enjoy in the winter.

If you enjoy tomato soup like I do, you will love this recipe. I used the italian tomatos and followed the recipe as directed. I did use my hand blender instead of transfering to the blender and creamed the soup right in the pot. the parmesan crackers are really good with the soup, buy a wedge of good parm and grate it coarsely.They didn't stick to my good cookie sheet.

I made this soup for a first course at a dinner party. It was a big hit. Everyone finished it. I thought the paremsan wafers were a great complement and would make them again. The flavors are rich but light at the same time. The roasting added a nice flavor. I really enjoyed it and so did my guests.

Unbelievably good! I have never felt compelled to leave a review before, but this is awesome! The flavors are incredible and it is so easy to make! My husband doesn't really care much for soup and thinks this is fantastic.

Terrific soup. It was great hot with the cream mixed in, it was great cold the next day with the cream drizzled on top, it was also great without any cream at all. I didn't make the wafers either, so can't comment on them. I doubled the amount of garlic and thought that was just right. Also, I ran out of oregano, so sprinkled fresh lemon-thyme on top of each serving. It looked wonderful and tasted delicious.

Rating: 4
Wow, this soup was amazing! I'm on Atkins, and anyone who is on a low-carb diet should find this a great add'n to the menu rotation, just watch the parmesan wafers (flour). The cream does add just enough sweet richness to make your mouth sing. Dress it up for a dinner party, or also fabulous with simple grilled cheese. Delish!

Rating: 4
Love, love, love this recipe! It was pretty easy when it was all said and done. I didn't make the wafers so I can't comment on them. I used lots of different tomatoes because the store didn't have a lot of any particular kind. Also, I roasted the tomatoes early in the day because of scheduling problems and just covered them till I was ready to use.

Rating: 4
Really great, robust flavour. I didn't make the parmesan crisps - I just sprinkled some on top. I used my hand blender and found that I didn't have to strain it. Served it with a crusty bread, great for cleaning the bowl - more dignified than licking it! I may add some fresh basil at the end, as another reviewer has suggested.

Rating: 4
Reduced the garlic by 50%, and added 2 additional cups of stock. We did not get the wafers, just let each individual grate a really good parmesan cheese into each serving. It was devoured! and everyone wanted the recipe.

Rating: 0
Wow, I couldn't disagree more with the previous reviewer. You seem to assume Danville slapped some processed cheese slices on Wonder bread. Grilled cheese, depending upon the type of bread and cheese used (and toppings like tomatoes) can be scrumptious and would be very well paired with this soup. Simple doesn't have to be ordinary.

This was one of the easiest soup recipes ever. I paired it with grilled cheese sandwiches which was perfect for a cool fall night. My family loved it! This will become part of my recipe collection.

Even though this recipe has gotten rave reviews, it was so good, I couldn't help but join in singing its praises! I do diet and cancer prevention research, and the tomato, onion, olive oil, and garlic are all winners in that world! I left out the parmesan wafers (to save a bit of time), but added a little shaved parmesan instead. Since I knew the cream would be tasty, I added half and half to decrease fat just a tiny bit. So good!

Made this soup with plum tomatoes from my yard. Followed the recipe, except I added 1 cup cooked brown rice. Everyone who tasted it, loved it. My husband who doesn't like tomato soup raved about it. And it's easy to make.

Outstanding soup! Didn't make the crisps, but served it w/ grilled cheese sandwiches. Frankly, the soup didn't really need the cream at the end as it was so delish. I added a bit of salt and a dash of cayenne pepper at the end. Otherwise, it was perfect as is.

This soup was STUNNING! We decided the wafers were good, but certainly didn't "make" the soup. Might or might not make them again, but the soup will be added to our favorites.

I made this recipe last week - it was the best tasting tomatoe soup - I've ever had. It had a really nice fresh taste...only thing for me is that it was a little thin - so next time - I'll use less broth/or more tomatoes. Definetly worth the time and effort.

Great flavours and very satisfying. I didn't add any cream or milk as it was rich enough as is - next time I will cut back on the olive oil and butter for a lighter version. Mmmmm...

I've made this soup twice now, and my family loves it. It is a little time-consuming, but worth the trouble. I didn't have cream - too rich anyway - and substituted low-fat sour cream, which was fine. Didn't bother with straining, etc., since I pureed it with a food mill.

Rating: 4
This one is a keeper. And easy to prepare! I managed to make this in the middle of a busy work week and had it all together long before my wife made it home. I thought that it would be a shame to remove the skins and the seeds - that's where all the flavour is! - so I just attacked the pot with a hand blender and ended up with a deliciously thick soup full of flavour and texture. After testing the first spoonful, it tasted so good that I didn't even bother with the cream. Try this and enjoy!

My husband and I really enjoyed this soup, but my kids did not like it at all. hmmmm, guess I'll make it again when they're off visiting their grandparents . . . paremsan wafers were really good, but like others, I made them smaller and my suggestion would be to really spread out the parm before baking . . . better appearance (snowflake-like).

I had some yellow tomatoes from my mothers garden and decided to try them. It was pretty good. I would make it again because it is fast and easy. Even my son who is quite picky liked it.

One of the best soups, a little time consuming but not bad and certainly well worth it. I made it the night before my dinner party so all I had to do was reheat. Would possibly add more garlic next time, or larger gloves although was perfect the way it was. Wouldn't change a thing, might try milk instead of light cream when not making for guest though.

Roasting the tomatoes and garlic results in a rich delicious flavor (and wonderful aroma while roasting as someone else noted!). I pureed the soup in a blender but still found the straining beneficial. I'll either skip the parmesan wafers next time or try the "crumbled crouton" suggestion that another reviewer had (my full review of these is with the wafer recipe). If that doesn't work for me, a nice crusty bread would be very nice with this. I tasted the soup both before and after adding cream -- It's good either way. I'm thinking of roasting the tomatoes and garlic again just to serve on sandwiches.

Rating: 4
This was really fantastic. I have recently started a low fat diet and as a previous reviewer stated it had a fantastic taste w/o the oil or cream. I used 1% milk just for a bit of the creamy flavor/texture and that worked great. Straining is important. I actually like some seeds so I used a regular pasta strainer so the skins got left behind but some of the seed made it though. Also, this came together very fast, the most time is taken by the roasting which doesn't need to be timed to perfection. I was busy in another room and went over 15 minutes..no problem. In my book worth 4*. TRY IT YOU'LL LIKE IT!!!

First of all I used home grown garden tomatoes - not plum - probably my first mistake. The soup came out too thin, therefore it wasn't as flavorful as all the other reviews suggest. It just doesn't seem worth the effort.

Made for dinner and got rave reviews from all. At first I thought it wasn't going to be enough for 7 diners but two got seconds. Definitely making this one again!

This soup was well worth the time it took to make. I must say that I could have eaten the pan of roasted tomatoes with olive oil and garlic just by themselves after they came out of the oven. They looked and smelled wonderful. I was expecting the tomatoes to take a while to cool, However after moving them from the pan to a rack they actually cooled to about room temperature relatively quickly. This soup has an excellent roasted flavor and consistancy. Quite superb.

Rating: 4
I had no idea that it was this easy to use up fall tomatoes to make a delicious soup. All I had was yellow tomatoes so it looked a little weird but tasted fabulous. As was suggested by another cook, I just put the tomatoes on parchment paper (they do make quite a mess) and skipped drizzling them with oil. I also ommitted the cream because I tasted it without and it was so good - but for a special occasion, I'll definitely add the cream. (I didn't try the wafers either).

Rating: 4
I very much enjoyed this recipe added dried basil about 1/2 tsp and used half and half instead of cream. I also used a sweet onion like Maui or Vidallia. Crushed the tomatoes in a colander to remove all skins and seeds. Not much work and well worth the little time it took to make it.

Rating: 3
This was delicious. I'm not sure I would bother straining the "solids" next time, as there were no chunks, just a thick puree remaining in the strainer. My husband and I enjoyed this very much. My two-year-old daughter enjoyed the Parmesan cracker quite a bit! Reynolds' Non-Stick Foil works just as well as a Silpat.

Rating: 4
This was fabulous. I know this is messing with perfection, but I thought next time I make it, I would try adding a couple of roasted red peppers to the mix. I plan on roasting up a bunch of plum tomatoes before the season is over, and freezing them to use in the winter. Yum!

This is an excellent soup with the cheese wafers. I made 2 changes in my soup by adding a large stalk of celery to the sauteing of the onion and sugar. Personally, I have a thing for keeping fiber in my diet so I didn't strain the soup. I used a 'hand blender' mixing in same cooking pot till smooth. No transfer of hot liquids and another pot. Add cream, wafers and serve. Go easy on the oregano, it can be overwelming. Hm Hm good!!

Great soup. This will probably be my standard tomato soup recipe from now on. Very light, despite the cream. It would be very easy to vary the flavors by adding a few herbs, etc.

The soup was ....scrumptious ! I used 50% milk and 50% cream. The wafers,(and this is the trick0,I did as follows : Mix dried oregano with a tsp olive oil, and spread very lightly over a slice(s) of wholemeal bread, (or the bread you like), put it under a hot grill for one minute,put parmesean shavings on top , return under grill for a further 40 seconds, take out wait for a few mins to cool, then cut into 1cm x1cm cubes, and sprinkle over the soup, 5 or 6 cubes each....or more if you are greedy... you will have a spectrum of flavours 'in concert' ... lip-smacking !! I am the guru !!

My husband said it was the best tomato soup he ever had. The parmesan wafers were very tasty but difficult to handle in the soup so I gave them a rough chop and sprinkled them on top like croutons, this worked very well and you get a parmesan shot in every spoonful.

this is a terrific recipe. It can have many variations. I diced up a home grown tomato (seeds and some juice removed), sprinkled chives and a little milk instead of cream. I served it with garlic broiled flat bread (pita), and some fresh veges from the garden. Yummeeee

What a great recipe - easy to make and tastes wonderful. I pureed it in the blender so that straining was not necessary. Also, I added a small amount of cream (1-2 Tablespoons) to each bowl and swirled it into the soup. Then I sprinkled some sliced basil on top and cracked pepper. Very nice and colorful presentation. My husband does not like tomato soup, but he loved this one.

I agree that this adapts very well to my lo-cal, lo-fat diet! I limit the drizzle to PAM spray, and roast the onions along with the tomato and garlic. I allow a few drops of pine nut oil to finish, along w/dollop of plain yogurt. Want to try roasting tomatoes on my Weber wood grill...!

This soup is full of flavor! The parmesan wafers really add to the soup. I made the wafers on pampered chef stoneware so I didn't use the bakeware liner. Don't make the wafers wider than your spatula otherwise they tend to fall apart. This was a big hit!

This is a GREAT soup to use up summer's bumper crop of tomatoes! I found it helpful (and better tasting) to well-oil the garlic cloves as well as the tomatoes -- when I didn't, they nearly burned; when I did, they squished out nicely. I've also frozen some roasted tom's and garlic, ready for an autumn soup!
