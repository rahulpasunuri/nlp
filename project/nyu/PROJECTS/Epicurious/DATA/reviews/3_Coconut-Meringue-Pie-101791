very disappointed with the filling of this pie - the cooking time seemed too short, as another reviewer mentioned, but adding time just resulted in a gummier, drier filling.

I've tried this recipe twice. The first time it was perfect. The second time, like many of the reviewers, even after extending the baking time it wouldn't set. The one variable was the brand of Cream of Coconut that I used. The recipe recommends Coco Lopez which was not available in my store, so I used JFC, made in Thailand, and it worked just fine. The second time I made it I used Goya, made in Dominica Republic. The Goya brand did not look like the JFC brand when I poured it out, but this recipe is my first experience with Coconut Cream so I didn't know the difference. The Goya brand did not work in this recipe for me. This is an absolutely fabulous pie, I would highly recommend it, but recognize not all brands of Cream of Coconut may work.

I made this for my husband (I hate coconut) and he loved it! I did have to bake it an extra 25 minutes, though. Based on the other similiar comments, someone needs to take another look at the recipe and see if either the temp or the cooking time is off.

Made this for a birthday and everyone loved it. I did bake it an extra 10 minutes and covered the edges of the crust for the extra baking.

My pie came out well- I used 14 oz can of Tropical Pepper Company Sweetened Cream of Coconut. I put the mixture in an unbaked crust that I had frozen and used 4 large egg yolk. I also increased the baking time in convection oven quite a bit until the filling set. I reduced the temp to 300 deg to do the meringue and put a little cocnut on top, increasint time til well browned. Delicious.

Simply delicious. I am making it again this Thanksgiving at the request of my friends. Last year they got up in the middle of the night and finished the leftover pie.

Everyone was right about the time being off. I added the additional 15 minutes and found it STILL needed 15 MORE minutes. I have a convection oven so I didn't understand how the cooking time could be so far off! The filling had no real substance...all you're eatting is tangy coconut. Being from the south, I can tell you we like our coconut pies with a more custard-y filling. I have to rank this pie as one of the WORST I have ever the displeasur of eatting.

I am a cook at the Cypress Grill in Kerrville Texas and I absolutley loved this recipe but I found that the cooking time needed to be extended about 15 to 18 minutes to give the pie the rite consistency.

Wonderful coconut flavor. So many recipes can disappoint with too little coconut. Not a problem here! While the flavor is great, the filling does not have that light texture that I prefer from cooked fillings. I also had to bake mine an extra 15 minutes to get the filling set. It was a bit surprising that the baking time was so off

I am not sure what I did wrong, the coconut portion was as runny after cooking as it was before I started. Don't know how to rate this one.

This is by far the best coconut meringue pie I have ever tasted. I made it for a Fourth of July party and everyone went crazy for it. Two thumbs up, this recipe is simple but delicious!

We loved the simplicity of this recipe since it didn't need cooking before filling the pie shell. It was absolutely delicious, and didn't taste like an amateur had made it. We used a gas oven, and we had to bake it about 15 minutes longer. This will definitely be a recipe we use frequently.
