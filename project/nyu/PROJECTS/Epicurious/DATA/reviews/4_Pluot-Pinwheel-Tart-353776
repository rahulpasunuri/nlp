I am about to make this for the third time! I've had rave reviews from everyone who's tasted it. It also works well with peaches or plums.

Pluots were a sweet surprise! I had never heard of them before, but when I tried one, I thought they were delicious. This is a fantastic recipe and the crust is not to be skipped. Everyone kept saying how they could just eat the crust straight off of the whole thing. Overall, the recipe was a hit.

I used a pie crust mix (gasp!) to save time on a week night, forgot the almond meal (which I had made myself) and it still turned out great. This could easily be made with other stone fruit. It is pretty.
