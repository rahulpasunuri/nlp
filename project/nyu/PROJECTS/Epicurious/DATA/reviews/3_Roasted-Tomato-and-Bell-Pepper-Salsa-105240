I've been making this salsa for years, getting great reviews. It's never been bland. I like a bit more heat so I serve it with a dollop of jalapeno laced sour cream.

This is a bland and lifeless salsa. Salsa should be either fresh or stewed. To spice this up I left out the red bell pepper, onion and added 3 roasted jalapenos instead. Don't peel them but do take out the innards. I added minced Scallions in the end and didn't puree quite so much. Add Garlic salt too and it will be a fresher tasting salsa. This is more of a salsa cruda (fresh) and will taste much better. For an added kick add a splash of lime juice and dash of olive oil....

Not bad, needs work though... Possibly roast some jalepeno chilies and omit the pepper flakes. I'm not a big fan of pureeing this mixture, because it reminds me of ketchup. Make sure to peel the tomatoes and peppers.... Possibly add some chipotle peppers to kick this recipe through the roof.

Very different/smokey taste. Not very spicey, and a little bland. Added juice of 2 lemons, and refridgerated 1 day before eating it. Add salt to taste. Did like it, and will make again with adjustments.

Very easy and tasty. Peel the tomatoes and pepper before you puree them and make it a day ahead.
