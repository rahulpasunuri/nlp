This recipe could benefit greatly from a graphic showing how the "collars" are wrapped around the ramekins. I cannot picture it.

Easy and elegant frozen dessert. I substituted whole evaporated milk for the cream. I used smaller ramekins and didn't fill it to the top. I then pooled the sauce on top with the sliced plums. Made 8. Leftover sauce is great on waffles.
