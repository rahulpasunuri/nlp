I can`t rate this recipe since I haven`t tried it but I think I will. It looks good. I`m not Jewish. Have googled the history of Charoset but have no idea of how it`s eaten in a meal. From my reading it appears to be a kind of relish or chutney. Perhaps I might be a Philistine but I think would be the perfect accompaniment for chicken. Can anyone let me know

TOO MUCH CLOVES! Good god. Why didn't I listen to myself when I questioned 1 whole teaspoon of cloves. My tongue is burning. Also needs something- some other fruit to lighten it- citrus? Apple?

Ms. Sussman makes a good effort, but her recipe has too many conflicting flavors and the wonderful tastes of sephardic charoset are overwhelmed by too much banana and spices more appropriate for pumpkin pie. She does offer a good basis for proportions. Just my opinion of course, but try these changes: reduce banana to one heat raisins and dates together in a microwave for 2 min, let sit 5 min, drain and puree. increase wine to 1/2 c. use 1 1/2 c toasted almonds and skip the walnuts and pistachios. add 1 peeled, trimmed orange for spices: just 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice.

how long is this recipe supposed to keep?

The best I've ever made! I substituted an apple for one of the bananas, upped the amounts of almonds and pistachios and omitted the walnuts, left out the honey, and used pomegranate wine instead of the grape. It looked appropriately mortar-like and was a great addition to the meal. I'm eating up the leftovers as a spread on matzoh for breakfast. YUM.

Delicious and easy, and I agree with previous reviews about not using 3 bananas. I used 2 and it still tastes too 'bananaish'. The bananas add texture, but next time I will try it with only 1 banana and maybe 25-26 dates. Happy Pesach!

I was looking for a recipe which most closely resembles my grandmothers. I went with this one but I changed a few things. It turned out great! I simplified the recipe by only using dates,dark (thompson) raisins, walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds wine honey and spices. I started with the suggested proportions but ended up adding a lot more wine. My grandmother cooks the mixture so I did the same, but quickly regretted it as I liked the flavor much better before cooking. Overall great flavor. Enjoy!

This is an easy, delicious, make-ahead dish that keeps well. The spices made me think of pumpkin pie or gingerbread.

I used relatively unripe, greenish bananas (it's what I had), and found the flavor of the other items came out nicely. It definitely improved over time (both in flavor and color).

I usually add chopped granny smith apples to add texture, toasted pine nuts instead of walnuts (a lot of children and adults don't like walnuts). This gets better and better with standing, but drain before serving so matzoh is dry.

Absolutely delicious! I ate the leftovers every day for breakfast on matza! I agree that it had a little too much banana taste now that it's mentioned, but I hadn't really noticed it before.

A little too heavy on the bananna - I would start with only 2 and add the third if necessary.

I read at least 20 different recipes for sephardic charosis before choosing this one. The 1st ingredient being dates attracted me, but I find the dominant flavor is banana. I believe next time I'll decrease the bananas to 1 and add, perhaps, sone nice currants and/or apricots mentioned in the other recipes.
