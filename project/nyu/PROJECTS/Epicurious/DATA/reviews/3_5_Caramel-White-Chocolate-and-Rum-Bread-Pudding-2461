I have made this at least three times for guests. Beyond being delicious, it always gets raves for the cook. Me!

i am a terrible caramel chef. as a result, i had a hard time with the caramel. when i cooled it in an ice bath it went hard and became unmanageable. after adding the eggs i reheated it carefully and got the caramel to become somewhat fluid again. the recipe turned out well after the caramel epic. wonderful flavor. i used french bread instead of wheat. i served it with vanilla ice cream.
