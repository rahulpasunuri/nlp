This is the first custard based ice cream I've made, so it's possible I don't like the genre, but never before has so much time and effort gone into something that had so little flavor. I've never had anything that tasted so lame including plain white rice. Fortunately I made it a day ahead and I'll mix it with an equal amount of a more flavorful recipe and hopefully salvage the nuts.

This is a comment to the cook below. Lyle's Golden Syrup, albeit quite tasty, is not an appropriate substitute for cane syrup. My grandmother served cane syrup straight from the makers (no middleman grocer) when I was growing up, and it was great, but extremely strong and viscous - much more like molasses than anything else. If you want to make it according to the recipe, I'd suggest molasses. But I imagine Lyle's makes for a great ice cream nonetheless.

This is delicious and the cane syrup does seem to give it a more interesting taste than one would expect of vanilla ice cream. I used Lyle's Golden Syrup, readily availble on store shelves here in the SF Bay Area; the label says "Cane Sugar Syrup" so I think it is the correct ingredient. I added a vanilla bean and used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I also caramelized the pecans in brown sugar before I added them to the finished ice cream. Very good.
