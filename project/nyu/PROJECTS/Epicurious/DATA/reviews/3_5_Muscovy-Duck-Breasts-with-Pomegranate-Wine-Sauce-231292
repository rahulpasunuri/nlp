I found a great way to make duck breasts with a wine sauce even simpler! The idea came from a Sur La Table class recipe for Panna Cotta with Red Wine Syrup. Simply take a bottle of dry,fruity red wine (Chianti) and 1 cup of sugar. Put the wine and sugar in a large saucepan and hear over medium-high heat to a boil. Reduce mixure to a volume of about 1 cup a about 18-20 minutes. Remove from syrup from heat and cool. While duck breasts are in the oven add the wine mixture to the 1 1/2 to 2 Tablespoons of reserved duck fat in the skillet and rewarm. Serve with duck! Don't forget to save the duck fat for other uses!!!

Maybe it's the brand of pomegranate molasses I used, but the sauce was quite tart when made by the recipe. A tablespoon of honey did the trick though. Also, cooking the duck to 145 will most definitely leave you with overcooked duck. If you want medium-rare, cook to 125, medium to 130. Otherwise, a great recipe.

More like 3.5 stars. The sauce was exquisite, but a complete pain in the rear, in my opinion. It took almost four times as long to reduce as the recipe called for, which threw off other kitchen operations. But what a flavor! I'm not a huge fan of marjoram, so substituted some fresh thyme instead, with good results. The duck breasts themselves were *perfect* - very moist, tender on the inside, crispy on the outside. I served them over top of a wild rice dressing with roasted Brussels sprouts on the side. Rave reviews all around!

Amazing Recipe. I have been cooking it for a few years and still love it every time. I substitute Tarragon for the Marjoram, but its great either way. I just prefer the way the tarragon plays with the duck and pomegranate more.

Thank goodness I saved the extra duck fat from this one (see previous review because I rarely give four forks) but having the duck fat with crispy brown bits for making Roasted Potatoes-Gourment 2001 definitely make this one a four forker!!!

The sauce is a lot of work, but worth the effort. Great technique for cooking the duck (the one's I got from D'Artangnan were fantastic). The cooking time in the oven is very much dependent on the temperature of the duck breasts before the searing. I made this on two days (4 halves each day). On the first the breasts were at room temperature (due to time to complete the sauce)and agree with another reviewer it only took 10-12 min to complete in the oven. On the second day they were much colder and it took the full 20 min in the oven. The end result on both days was fantastic-but I enjoyed more on the second because I didn't have to work as hard!!! Will definitely make this one again for special occasion.

This wasn't bad, and everyone liked, but not loved it, but considering the amount of work that went into what ended up being a fairly boring sauce, it was defintely not worth it.

I have made this twice now, the only difference being that I don't use an oven at all, I cook the duck in a skillet only. When I set the duck aside to finish cooking while it sits, I add the sauce directly to the skillet and perform the final simmer there. This is simply the best duck recipe that I have tried so far.

Made for Christmas Eve dinner, for the fam, and even my little sisters who "don't eat duck" chowed down. TRY!

Made this for Valentine's day dinner, and it was a huge success. Roasted some potatoes in the surplus duck fat, and served it with broccoli and a watercress and arugula salad. Only substitution was to omit the beef broth. Delicious!

I've made this dish twice and it is delicious! The cooking time on the duck seems too long - when I use a meat thermometer, it's done (medium rare) in about 12 minutes.

We don't care for sweet sauces, so used pomegranate concentrate in case it might be less sweet than the molasses. A delicious new year's eve dinner.

Delicious! Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I also used homemade pomagranate molasses since my store was sold out of the bottled kind.

My family LOVED this! It was very similar to a dish we had at a 5 star restaurant near us. I was surprised at how great the sauce was. I made my own pom molasses and it was easy.

The duck was OK, but I thought the pomegranate molasses was a tiny bit too strong.
