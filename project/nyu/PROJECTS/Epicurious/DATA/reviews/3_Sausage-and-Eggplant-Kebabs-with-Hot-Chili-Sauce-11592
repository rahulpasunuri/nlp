Easy and quite good. I only used one jalapeno because that was all I had on hand and really, that was all it needed. Seems like a kind of fusion dish - Italian with a Thai marinade - and it really worked. I was pleasantly surprised because I wasn't at all sure how it would taste. Would definitely make again.
