Delicious combination of flavors. Leave out the anchovies, sauce doesn't need the nasty tasting ingredient-UGH! Added extra capers. Compliments the shrimp in Garlic Shrimp with Roasted Garlic-Herb Sauce very well. Would go with marinated chicken breasts too.

This was great, I have made numerous times with both shrimp and steak sandwiches with grilled onions and red and green peppers

i loved thethe strength of flavors in this sauce. bet it would be good with chicken or add parmegian cheese for a salad dressing maybe with more oil.. I am using the remainder for pizza with carmelized onions mushrooms etc.... summer tomatoes

My son made this with the shrimp, and the sauce was better than the shrimp! I used the rest of the sauce as dressing for roasted golden beets and feta cheese. Yummmmmmmm! Easy and versatile, what more can you ask?

With the grilled shrimps it IS a winner. Go big with the garlic

I have made this sauce (and grilled shrimp) recipe three times - it is delicious with just about everything! I agree with other reviewers regarding the large amount of oil - I add the oil just until the consistency is what I like.

Excellent! Good with other grilled seafoods and even steaks. Great on grilled/broiled/toasted breads and makes a wonderful pasta sauce, with or without other additions, like veggies. Use a very good quality olive oil for best results, not just the every day off the shelf stuff.Soaking and rinsing the anchovies in milk is a very good idea to reduce saltiness. More garlic is not a bad thing, especially since it is first roasted.

I made this sauce to accompany grilled halibut, which I served with basmati rice and roasted carrots and red onion. Since I'm in the habit of eyeballing -- rarely measuring precisely -- I'm sure I didn't overdo it with the oil... I will try this with the grilled shrimp or in a manner similar to that described by the cook from New York! We loved it!

The flavor was very good. I would use this sauce for other veggies too.

I doubled all the ingredients except the oil. I used only 1 cup. This leaves a consistency fine for spreading thin slices of baguettes and lightly broiling for appetizers. I freeze pesto into small usable portions. You can always add more oil later to thin out. I rinse/soak my anchovies in milk. This doesn't need salt because of the anchovies.

We had some of this sauce left over (served it with the grilled shrimp) so we sauted it with shrimp, shallots, and plum tomatoes and served it over whole grain penne with feta. Even better than than with the grilled shrimp.

Good flavor, but I agree with with another reviewer's comment - too much oil. I'll cut it next time.

You can freeze this - I make batches of pesto every summer and they freeze just fine.

This is not a review, but a question: Would this freeze? I just bought a huge quantity of garlic for a photo shoot, and don't want to waste it. I wondered if the oil and freezer combo might act as an acceptable preservative. Any ideas?

Too much oil, the flavors were good, but overwhelmed by the oil. I'd cut back on the oil if I were to make it again
