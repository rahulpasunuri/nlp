I had a couple of issues with this recipe, but overall it turned out really nice. Making the tortellini - I struggled to understand the instructions and pictures. After making 7 that looked nothing like tortellini, I decided to make life simpler and turn them into half-moon ravioli instead. Also, the recipe says this makes 12 appetizer portions although doesn't specify how many per person. I ended up getting 33 circles out of the dough (went through my pasta machine up to #6, at which point it was thin enough to see through). Less than 3 per person doesn't cut it, even if you are keeping portions small. Making fresh pasta is a lot of work, and I like to yield more than a few dozen at a time. The pasta dough itself was one of the best i've worked with, and will definitely come back to this for future use. For the filling, i tweaked it a bit by adding sauteed turnip greens and left out the Parmesan (didn't have) but otherwise left it the same. The filling, while simple to prepare and very good, made way, way more than needed.
