Great, simple, summer dish. I grill marinated chicken to top the pasta for a complete meal.

The recipe is simple, however cooking the garlic in Olive Oil made the garlic clump together. That in turn made it cook unevenly and burn a little. That turned the flavor of this dish very bitter and unpleasant. Overall, the dish is alright.. just avoid the clumping. An alternative to using Olive Oil would be butter. That would prevent clumping. Also cook it so it's not golden, but pre-golden for a better flavor

I tried this recipe today. I substituted angel hair pasta, and I added shrimp, broccoli, and chiken broth at the end.

Perfect side dish, I served it with the Roasted Crab Cioppino. I did add extra lemon juice and zest. Delicious!

Simple and easy. Added extra lemon juice, splash of vermouth and basil. I first cooked shrimp on sliced garlic and then added it back in at the end.

I liked it but wanted even more flavour. I added scallops and think would add white wine or flavoured stock and or some more herbs to it, basil or thyme. Big advantage is that it is extremely quick and easy. You could adapt this and add some chevre, peas, chicken, other variations on hand.

This is absolutely a wonderful change from tomatoes. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again and again. I used angel hair pasta which I prefer.
