I thought this tapenade was great, although the end result is highly dependent on whether you use good olives. I made it for a get together a year and a half ago, and my father in law keeps talking about it. I'm making it again for our super bowl party. For people who are omitting the anchovy fillet: it's an integral piece of the puzzle. It will not taste fishy at all, it'll just give it great complexity and more umami. Give it a shot!

I'm hosting our gourmet group's "Mediterranean Night" this weekend and made this to serve as an appetizer. Oh my goodness, so yummy!! Thinking I should have made a double batch and kept half for myself!! Completely addicting! :)

I made this recipe exactly then used it to cover all sides of some cut-up turkey thighs (bone-in), potatoes, carrots, bell peppers and mushrooms and braised it in a chicken stock/wine mixture. Heavenly Provencal. Even my 13-yr old daughter that claims not to like olives snarfed it up.

Delicious! I have taken this to several parties and am always asked for the recipe.

Great tapenade. I make ahead but add the fresh herbs the day of. It is always gone in a hurry.

Great little tapenaded as is!or "go to". Reviewers, rmember that if you change a recipe then review it you aren't reviewing the given recipe. So....try the stated recipe then tweak it for your own tastes!

Wonderful, however did make a number of adjustments. Did not use oven-dried tomatoes, used dried currants instead (martha stewart suggestion). Omitted anchovy and garlic altogether. Herbs: parsley, oregano, and marjoram. Added the juice of 1 lemon. Added a few tablespoons of chopped walnuts (martha again). Tablespoon sized mounds on top of crostini spread with goat cheese. Served at baby shower and got rave reviews--all were eaten and I had to fight for one to try.

This is my preferred tapenade. The tomatoes add a sweetness that tames the saltiness of the olives and capers. I use sundried tomatoes packed in oil - no need to blot them...just use less olive oil.

Outstanding!!!! Hard not to consume the entire batch standing at the kitchen counter! Salty, savory and delicious. I too added more garlic and sun-dried tomatoes (blotting the oil) with kalamata and green olives.

excellent. with the exception of not buying pitted olives, the recipe was quick and delicious, especially good with seared tuna.

I used sun dried tomatoes from a jar and pitted kalamata and larger pitted green olives from the deli at the local grocery. I omitted the anchovy filet but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It travels easily and was a winner with friends who all wanted the recipe.

Delicious! I made some slight modifications - extra garlic and tomatoes (sun dried tomatoes from Trader Joe's) and dried oregano since I didn't have any fresh. I just made a half batch in my mini-cuisinart and it came out perfect! Will definitely be making it again.

Outstanding recipe. So long store-bought tapenade! This recipe is much more flavourful. This is a keeper.

I make this every summer when with fresh herbs out of the garden. We have tried high quality olives yet. It still is tasty with regular green olives and either black olives or Kalamata olives.

This was excellent! We are very fortunate in having fine specialty markets close to home so finding each specific olive was easy. I prepared as shown and it was VERY well received.

Delicious. If possible, buy higher quality olives and make sure to use fresh herbs. This is an outstanding recipe. Leftover tapenade is wonderful on pasta too. Mix a bit of pasta water with the tapenade to make the sauce.

Wow - how simple. I did not take time to measure everything percisely nor did I add the dried tomatoes (I was too lazy). But it is super, really super.

Far less heavy handed than a commercial jar of tapenade. You can control the quality of the olive to take this to the highest level (buy fresh in bulk, not jarred or canned). The addition of fresh herbs is key, in particular the oregano. Using dried herbs or skipping one of the herbs would be disastrous. If you follow this closely, it will be a hit. I used it with a recipe for Goat Cheese Tartines with Tapenade. Excellent.

This lacked flavor. I have had better out of a jar.

This was delicious. I made it as directed except I used one can of green olives and one can of black olives. Everyone asked for the recipe. Roasting the tomatoes was a bit of work but definatly worth the end result.

Wow! First time making homemade tapenade and I will never buy it from a store again. This was delicious and incredibly easy. I used only Kalamata olives and sun dried tomatoes and the result was a winning appetizer.

This was so delicious and very easy. I don't have a food processor, and chopping everything works just as well. Its a great party food and can be made well in advance.

I want to put this on everything. It keeps for at least a couple weeks and gets even better after a few days.

This is excellent and easy. I am marinating it overnight to infuse flavors. Beautiful color and consistency.
