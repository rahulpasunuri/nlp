Excellent recipe for a quick nutritious meal. We also used butter and a bit of two percent milk in the potatoes.

This is such a quick meal to make! I would substitute butter for the oil in the potatoes. Otherwise, a great springboard recipe to creat from.

This meal was perfectly fine, but very straightforward and not terribly exciting. Don't think I'd make it again, although it is extremely simple.
