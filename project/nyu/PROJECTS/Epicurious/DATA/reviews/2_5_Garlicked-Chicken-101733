Candace- cook the chicken until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees. To the cook from Kenmore, WA- yes, this recipe does call for a lot of butter. If you notice the year it was published that explains a lot. If you are looking for recipes with a lower fat content you should try Cooking Light Magazine. They have a lot of reformulated ones. By the way, I wouldn't delete any of the butter, I thought it was delicious!

Waaaaay too much butter! Holy clogged arteries! No wonder James Beard croaked!
