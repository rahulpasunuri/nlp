It was alright. I was underwhelmed. It just tasted like spinach to me. I don't know what the difference is between water spinach and regular spinach, but I had to use the latter because I couldn't find the former. And if you're one of those people afraid of salt, don't be; this dish needs it. It would've been really really bland without it.
