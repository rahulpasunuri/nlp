I tried a leftover latke in place of the mashed potato. Over the latke I cracked an egg, 1tbl. cream and some shredded parm. cheese. So very good!

Made this for Easter brunch and we all thought they were amazingly good (though really rich). For those that find it difficult to tell when they are done, shake one of the ramekins to see how wobbly the eggs are. If they look totally sloppy, then they're not set enough. They should jiggle like jello. I ended up leaving mine in a minute or two longer than the recipe called for (all of my ingredients were at room temp when I assembled them), and they were perfect.

My husband and I both thought this was delicious (and neither of us are major egg-eaters). I used less shallots than in the recipe (about 1/2) and thought it was just right. The only thing that stopped this from being a "four fork recipe" for me was that I found it very difficult to tell when the eggs were done cooking...under the cream and the cheese, it was hard to tell the doneness of the whites. Otherwise, this was an all-star recipe.

I made this recipe for a lunch this morning. I wish I'd have left the egg off of it, because the mashed taters were amazing. Seriously, the best I've had in a while. But that egg? Gimme a break (no pun intended). It just ruined otherwise good mashed potatoes. My advice, just serve it without the egg.

Yum! Made this at boyfriend's Mom's for Sunday brunch. She only ate half of hers as she's trying to eat healthy, but so delicious! Followed other reviewers' advice on the timing.

did a trial run before brunch this sunday...used leftover potatoes from awesome lamb dinner the other night. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. 17 min produced a perfect result eventhough I only made one portion. Done with trials. On the menu. So good. So easy. My boyfriend is insisting I make it again this weekend for the real deal. Can't argue...was really that good.

omg,I am eating while I am writing this review...heavenly! Made as a "test drive" since I had left over sage garlic mashed potatoes this morning. Did not use any other herb, but the chives. It took 17 mins @350, and a couple mins under the broiler. Runny and perfect!

Really nice recipe. My wife said it was "Really good comfort food." It didn't seem quite done at 17 minutes so I left it in for 20. That turned out to be too long though. If you take it out at 17 minutes, I think the residual heat will finish it just right during the time it takes to get it to the table.

We have done with both potatoes and homemade corned beef hash. Both are excellent!

I don't quite understand why this dish charms me so much, but it does. Like so many excellent and simple recipes, it is greater than the sum of its parts. If I were an egg, this is how I'd want to be eaten.

I made thses with left over mashed potatoes and added some herbs. I did not use a water bath. The potatoes crisped around the edges. Delicious! I did heat the potatoes in the microwave until hot. I baked the eggs just 12 minutes in a toaster oven. Perfect!

Good recipe 3.5 Forks. I used the potato mixture directly after it was done- no cooling. I baked at 350 for 12 min using the oven's convection setting. The yolk was over medium. The addition of the cream may lead you to believe the egg is not completely cooked- don't be fooled. After I removed it from the oven I let it sit for about 3 min and then served.

Excellent dish, beautiful and subtle flavours. Complemented mine by adding 1/4 tsp of white truffle infused oil to the cream. Be careful not to overcook: 17 minutes is enough if you like your egg yolk runny/creamy. Was a hit in my brunch.

This is a delicious brunch recipe and very easy to do. I didn't trust the baking time and left them in a tad bit longer - maybe one or two minutes - and it was a bit too long but still they were fabulous. If you are running a bed and breakfast, this recipe is for you. Serve with fresh fruit and/or a tossed salad.

I made this for Thanksgiving brunch (though I lightened it up a bit) and it was a big hit with everyone!

This dish was delicious. The grocery store ran out of rosemary so I used a generous portion of fresh oregano along with the thyme, it gave it a wonderful flavour. I also used a muffin tray because I did not have ramekins and the eggs came out perfectly. I kept the potatoes and eggs at room temperature before baking. It was a real hit at a family brunch - would definately make again.

this dish was fabulous! (you don't sound like a smarty pants at all, especially when you don't seem to have read it correctly)

I plan on trying this for a weekend brunch. I don't like to sound like a smartypants, but to the cooks who were asking about the potatoes, it says in the recipe to chill, then bring to room temperature before adding them to the ramekins.

What a decadant breakfast treat! I brought the potatoes to room temp-also increased oven temp to 400. I served with a warm, crusty country bread. Divine.

My new breakfast. Only issue is the cooking times, still haven't got that right. Also, do you put the mashed potato's in hot? It took over 30 minutes to cook when they went in cold.

What a simple dish to make for breakfast! Next time, I will use a larger ramekin and add two eggs.

I made this for brunch when my kids came to visit, everyone said it was great.
