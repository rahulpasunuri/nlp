Excellent cookie! Dough was a bit too crumbly so I added 1 Tbsp lemon juice plus a scant tsp cream. Rolled them in ground almonds before baking. Got great reviews at Easter brunch!

I loved this recipe! I added lots of lemon juice and zest as well as some cardamom extract and vanilla bead. For the filling I used star anise flavored dulce de leche. I must say the cookies were buttery and delicious. I didn't have any trouble forming the dough.

I used 4 ounces of powdered sugar instead of the granulated and put homemade lemon curd in the fingerprints. Yummy!

Excellent recipe! As per suggestions, added 3tbsp lemon juice and zest of 2 lemons and increased sugar to 3/4 cup. Made with my 6 year old son. Fun and cute but mostly yummy!

Yum! A pleasantly lemony shortbread-y cookie. Made according to directions, except with 2 tbsp lemon zest instead of 3 because I ran out of lemons, and double the lemon juice to compensate. The dough was difficult to roll into balls, very sticky. Then I realized I could dip my hands in flour before rolling each cookie which made the dough much easier to roll. In my oven they cooked in about 15 minutes but tasted fine even though they looked a bit charred. Next time I'd use more than a scant 1/2 tsp jam.

I took this recipe up a notch by dipping the balls of dough into beaten eggwhites and rolling into chopped walnuts before thumbprinting them. After baking, I dropped raspberry jam into the print and had a festive christmas cookie. In the past I have used pecans in place of walnuts and this was great, too.

These cookies (as well as the batter) are delicious. A tad floury, but really good.

Awesome. I used lemon curd instead of jam. They were very lemony, but we loved them!

To the other reviewers who don't think this is lemony enough, try to find jarred lemon zest. I have a big jar of the stuff from Perfect Puree of Napa Valley, it is much easier than zesting lemons and very handy to have in the fridge!

These turn out nice and tart, not too sweet. The dough is a lot like shortbread and needs to be shaped after making the "thumbprint". It is a bit labor intensive to get them to look nice and round, but worth taking the time to do. I used a combination of red plum and raspberry jam, mixed it with a couple tablespoons of sugar to cut the tartness, and added prior to baking.

Easy to make and very good. Zested two lemons, which looked about right, but I will probably use one more next time for extra flavor.

These are great, tender little cookies! Make sure to increase the lemon juice and/or zest. I use a the back of a little measuring spoon to make DEEP wells, and then I fill them with jam (raspberry! yum!) before baking. I make icing (powdered sugar + lemon juice) and drizzle it over the baked, cooled cookies. These cookies look fantastic and adorable! Sure to impress!

I found these to be very tender and delicate and will make them again for sure. The key is to treat the dough gently and not overwork or it will get tough. I used 3/4 c. of sugar, beat the sugar and butter until light and used 2 tbsp. of lemon juice and no zest. I re- dented the cookies 1/2 way through the cooking time with the back of a measuring spoon. Next time I will also add a touch of vanilla or almond extract.

Pretty good recipe. I made mine with raspberry and strawberry jam. The raspberry really complimented the tartness of the lemon. Excellent crisp, delicate texture. They are great made the first day because, as the recipe states, they begin to soften. However, I did omit the grated lemon peel (I was worried about a bitter taste) and replaced it with the juice of one lemon. Would make again. Nice for entertaining.

i added orange zest and used myer lemon and filled the cookies with some strained leftover berry compote and lemon curd. also added the filling before baking...the results were tasty and our guests were quite pleased.

I used the zest of three full lemons and little extra juice. The cookie was great. Nice flavor, great texture and tooth feel. I filled with seedless raspberry and mint (for red and green Xmas cookies). I thought both were wonderful, though the mint got mixed reviews. An excellent recipe.

I found the cookie to be very tender. The blueberry jam I used was an excellent contrast to the tartness of the base. An adult cookie!

I really liked this cookie, even though i usually prefer softer cookies. The slightly lemoney cookie was a perfect complement to the sweet jam in the filling. Make sure to not skimp on the lemon zest.

Very little flavor, other than to waste some good jam.

These were okay. I halved the recipe but used just one cup of flour, used the zest from one lemon, and the juice from half a lemon, I also added almost a teaspoon of vanilla. The dough was very easy to make. I did refrigerate it for 15 min. before handling. I thought the lemony flavor was strong enough but I wish these were just a little sweeter. My toddlers helped make them and loved eating them. I would only make again because they were simple and fast, not for the flavor, even though I did think they tasted *okay* not great.

Thanks to all of the reviewers who claimed these cookies to not lemony enough, I added about 3 times the amount of juice and zest, making a very tart batch of cookies. The dough was tough to work with, and the finished product wasn't very attractive. They tasted- good. I did put the jam in before baking, and would definitely suggest it. Didn't quite do it for me- will not be making these again.

I was sadly disappointed in these cookies. Despite an additional tablespoon of lemon juice, I didn't find these to be very lemony. The dough was incredibly difficult to work with. Refrigerating for 20 minutes or so helped. I recommend reducing the amount of flour or adding more liquid to get a dough that holds together.

These cookies are fabulous!!! Loved the lemon flavor!!! I used red current jam as the topping. I love anything lemon and these are delicious!!!

I had really high hopes for this cookie after everyone's reviews. But I think the cookies came out dry. I personally hate the jam on top - maybe it's just the one I bought. I used apricot. I really made these for my dad who loves lemon, so hopefully he'll like them. Otherwise, they're going on the trash. Yuck.

This is an amazing, fast and super yummy cookie recipe! I personally wanted a more buttery flavor so I subtracted the lemon peel, halved the juice and rolled them in chopped walnuts (using egg whites) for a little added texture. This turned out excellently, buttery melt in your mouth cookies! It made a lot more cookies than I had intended but I got no complaints because the entire batch dissapeared winthin 2 days, and everyone that tried them is still asking for more.

Rating: 3
Easy and very tasty. For all the lemon zest (I zested four lemons to get the 3 tbsp, though I may have been slightly over), the lemon is palpable, but not overpowering, and pairs well with any berry jam. I used strawberry, wild blueberry, orange marmalade and blackcurrant jams, with blackcurrant and wild blueberry coming off best. Raspberry and blackberry would also be particularly good in this recipe. I made as written, and these disappeared quickly when I took them in to work. I was sorely tempted to try lemon curd as another filling, but sadly was too short on eggs to give that a try.

this was a great recipe! i used measuring spoons to make very deep wells and it was perfect! the wells kind of flatten when they bake, so be sure to make them very deep. i added a lot more zest and lemon juice because i like my cookies very lemony. i piped lemon curd into the indentations and they were great. i also had some surprise company and these were luckily on hand, and my guests raved. next time i plan on omitting all of the lemon to make little butter cookies and i'll pipe chocolate filling into them.

Love these cookies! I followed advice from other reviewers: cut the flour to 2 cups, increased the lemon zest to 4 tblsp and juice to 3-4 tblsp. I chilled the dough for about 15 minutes and this really helped with handling. Blackberry and Cherry jams before baking - yummy! I didn't bake for 22 minutes, this would have charred the bottoms in my oven; I removed them at about 16 minutes. Not only delicious, but super easy and fast.

I love the recipe just the way it is. It's so simple to make. 2 thumbs up!

I would add more zest or some lemon extract next time. They are good, just not as lemony as I would like. I refrigerated the dough before making the cookies. It made it much easier to work with.

These truly are great cookies...just made them for the first time and love 'em! Like some of the other cooks I added more lemon zest and juice. They are the best...I know I will have to make twice as many next time...I know two people who would eat the entire batch !

These cookies are incredible! I added a second tablespoon of lemon juice (just because I juiced a whole lemon and that is what I got), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The cookies have a nice lemon flavor and are buttery and tender. I used my 1/2 teas. measuring spoon to make the indentation for jam and it made nice uniform indentations. Yum!

Great recipe. For those who really like the flavour of lemon, try adding poppyseeds to the dough mix and, instead of jam, fill with lemon curd just before serving.

Just made this recipe using some of the hints from the prior bakers. Still not lemony enough. Iused 5 tbsn of lemon zest, 2 tbsp of lemon juice, 2 cups flour and filled them before baking. I buttered parchment and baked them in convection at 350 for 16 min. I will now try them with 8 tbsn zest, more lemon juice and increase the flour a little. Any one know of a really lemony bar or cookie, one to make your mouth pucker. I'm not into sweets and this is for a cookie exchange. Thanks

The flavor of these cocokies is wonderful--so lemony. I found that they were a little dry and crumbly so I think next time I will reduce the flour to two cups instead of two-and-a-half. Any homemade, cooked down jam would be great. I used my new Brooks Plum jam because the color is so vibrant and it the natural pectin gives it a glossy look.

Pretty great cookies. I substituted grapefruit and orange zest/juice. very good

For some reason this dough would not stay together for me, like it was a little dry! Can't figure out why (I know I measured the flour exactly), but to salvage them I pressed a thin layer onto a cookie sheet, then spread the jam in a thin layer over the top. After baking, I cut them into bar cookies. They ended up absolutley delicious!! Definitely use the fresh lemon zest and lemon juice, it makes such a difference. They also kept well for many days!

The end results were very good. However, the dough was very, very, soft. I had to add more flour. The cookies are very lemony and good. I will definitely make them, again.

This recipe is fabulous! I would definitely increase the lemon zest in the recipe, and usually use apricot jam -- it enhances the flavor of the dough. I have never tried adding the jam after the cookies are baked because adding jam and then baking it with the cookies has turned out so well. My boyfriend constantly asks for these now.

Rating: 3
Delicious, light cookies. I must not have made my 'thumbprint' deep enough because the cookies flattened. I'm pretending they are lemon shortbread cookies! On the cookies I filled prior to baking, the filling ran out. Maybe more flour to help hold the shape better?

The best ever with great lemon flavor. Everybody raved... melt in your mouth. I used blueberry on some and raspberry on others... some with jam before baking, some after. A keeper.

Rating: 3
Nice lemon taste - I added a bit of lemon extract in addition to the lemon zest. I used raspberry jam (100% fruit) spooned in before baking, which is a nice combination. I doubled the recipe and froze most of them. They've been frozed for a week now, I just thawed one and ate it and it tastes great still. I recommend eating these a day after you make them. As with most butter cookies, they taste a bit floury the first day, but everything sort of melds by the next day and they aren't floury anymore.

This is a great recipe! Everyone loved these. I love lemon, but not when it's a real sweet lemon, and this was great as this cookie is more like a butter cookie. I used blueberry jam and definetly reccommend spooning it in prior to baking. I also used whole wheat flour and a little lime zest when I ran low on the lemon zest, which was great. I will make these again and again.

Brought the cookies to work. Everyone loved them. Recipe states that you can either put the jelly on before or after baking. I made one batch of each. Everyone seemed to prefer the ones with the jelly baked with the cookies. They seemed to travel better also, jelly is more set with the baked ones. I used Polamer All Fruit jam-cherry. I thought it tasted great. I guess everyone else did too, all the cookies were gone.

In the mad dash to make X-mas cookies this year, this one's looking like a B+. I used a suggestion from a previous reviewer and filled them with little dabs of lemon curd, and I think it was a great idea. They wouldn't have been terribly lemony otherwise. They were a little bit floury, but got good reviews.

The dough was scrumptious and buttery, but I thought the cookies came out pretty boring. Maybe a little icing would help. They are attractive, though. I halved the recipe and still got about 30. Also, I cooked them for fifteen minutes.

I found the 22 minutes of baking to be too long; the first batch burned in 20 min. I baked them 12-15 and they were done. I also made a few changes to the recipe and they were delicious: After forming dough into balls, I rolled them in finely chopped pecan then baked them. Instead of jam, I made an icing with confectioners sugar and lemon juice with a drop of yellow food color. Nice and lemony!

This is a really great, easy cookie. Here's my tip: Use 1-1/2 tsps Boyajian's lemon oil in place of the zest. They'll come out with a really fresh lemon taste without having to grate zest. You still need the lemon juice to help bind it. These are outstanding cookies.
