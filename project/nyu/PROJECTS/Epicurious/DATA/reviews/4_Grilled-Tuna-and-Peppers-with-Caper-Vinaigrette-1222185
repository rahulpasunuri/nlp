Delicious. Not over the top. This is super easy to make. I used red, yellow and orange bell peppers, tossed in a little olive oil and then grilled (in a stir fry pan for the grill). I served ths with some grilled zucchini on the side. A wonderful, light, low carb weeknight meal for sure.

Loved it, and it's already in my recipe box! I used multicolofred baby peppers and a few multicolored fingerlings, halved lengthwise, and threw them under the broiler a few minutes before adding the tuna so it was all done at the same time. The vinaigrette is simple, beautiful and the perfect counterpoint -- what a great way to usher spring in!

Tasty! Nice mild flavor.

Great flavors; vinaigrette is perfect balance of salty/tangy/fresh. Used orange and yellow peppers since they're what's growing here and they worked fine.

This is an incredibly simple, elegant and tasty dish. It took me longer to grill the vegies I had on the side (asperagus, onions and red and yellow peppers) than to make, prepare and cook the fish. Will definitly make again and pass on the recipe.

I love caper sauces but this was a bit bland for me. Next time I will make the caper sauce in advance and let it intensify. I chilled one portion, as I suspect that this will make a great cold dish. Also, I had frozen tuna, cooked on the stove. I might have lost some flavors there, too.

I had to modify this based on what I had in house. No peppers or parsley - added shallots to the vinaigrette. Other than that I pretty closely followed the recipe. Husband and 3.5 yr old son loved it. I thought it was very good but maybe over powered the tuna flavor a bit more than I would have liked. I'd make it again, though.

Although my husband loved it, it did nothing for me. Bland and too much lemon.

Delicious...left out the capers, but sauce would be good on anything! Made this with rice and yellow peppers, but could vary that.

Excellent. Easy. When the kids didn't complain about the capers, what more can you say?

I have made this dish many times and everyone loves it. Tonight will be the first time I've made it with previously frozen tuna. However I'm hopeful the tasty sauce will more than make up for the lack of fresh tuna.

Easy, Delicious, Perfect summer (or any season) meal! I thought it might not be flavorful enough with the vinaigrette just spooned on after grilling, but it was perfect. I have made it twice already and would have made it more but I do not own a grill. I look forward to making it again, on someone else's grill! Don't worry if you can't get the peppers, the tuna is delicious on its own, too.

I love this recipe. It is so easy and the sauce is perfect with the grilled tuna. My husband loves it as well. I usually up all the ingredents for the sauce to make a little extra. I often make Israeli couscous or orzo as a side and toss with a little of the vinaigrette. I will try tossing the extra vinaigette with green beans next time as some have suggested. A definite keeper in my repetoire.

The dressing made this dish great. Next time, I'll double the dressing and throw it over the green beans and rice, too,

Delicious. I used swordfish and cut to place on skewers. Also added a sweet onion. I was wondering whether it was mistake not to marinate but decided to follow the rest of recipe as written. Very glad I did. The sauce spooned over the skewers was just right. Loved it.

We enjoyed this recipe with a pasta salad, green beans, and a black bean and papaya salsa complimented with a nice Spanish red wine. Very nice I'v saved it in my recipe box.

I prepared the tuna well done, by preference, and served with fresh green beans and sourdough bread with olive oil and parmesan cheese. The vinaigrette is stunning, a nice contrast to the quiet steak- like fish. The following day the remaining tuna steak was made another debut, this time sliced with mesclun mixed greens, spicy radishes, celery, all tossed with the remaining vinaigrette. A delicious low-fat "leftover" meal. Wow!

I served this on greens as a main-course salad. It was great. I used a regular green pepper and sauteed it until it was blackened, then grilled the tuna in my broiler.

This was really good, and easy. I don't have a grill or a grill pan, so I just heated a heavy non-stick fry pan with oil til very hot and used that. I also used defrosted bell pepper strips and they came out pretty well too. The dressing is what really makes the dish.

Simply delicious! The sauce complements rather than competes with the taste of the fish. I used swordfish and made Sophia Loren's mom's peppers as a side. Thus, I omitted the pepper topping. My husband thought there was too much oil in the sauce, so next time I'll decrease it.

Absolutely delicious and ridiculously easy to make. Grilled peppers and fish never tasted so good!!

This recipe is outstanding. I have a new way to enjoy fresh tuna. This is also easy to make for a dinner party as it's very easy to make in quantity.

Wonderful, fresh and quick. I used spicy oriental mustard since I didn't have dijon and it was extrememly tasty. The caper vinaigrette would be excellent on chicken, steamed veggies or pasta, as well as fish.

Italian fry peppers are sometimes called cubanelles.

to the cook who wanted to know about Italian Fry Peppers. They are a mild green pepper shaped similar to an Anaheim Chili, but without the spicy heat. They have a milder flavor than a bell pepper. I think a bell pepper would be the closest substitution.

What is an Italian fry pepper? Does it have another name, or can you suggest a substitution?
