This is a great alternative to apple pie. It is much easier and more flavorful. I used dried apples and apple cider fresh from Crane's Apple Orchard in Michigan. The flavor was out of this world.

This recipe was easy and delicious! I would definitely make it again. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I may never use fresh apples again! Highly recommended.

This tart was fantastic!! I also used fresh apples, and the crowd went wiled. I have never gotten reviews about a desert that I have made like this one. I put in a vanilla pod which added another level of flavor, as well I didn't have any cider so I used apple juice. I am most definitely going to make it again and very soon.

This recipe has become an all-time favorite - a real crowd pleaser. However, I should add that I've never made it with dried apples. I've always used fresh. I saute about 8-12 apples in the same mixture the dried apples call for, but just less. I also use a spring tin instead of regular pie pan and press the crust about 2 inches high. It makes for a dramatic presentation.

I made this dessert for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. The dried apple filling was richer, more luscious and more subtle than any fresh apple pie would have been, especially with the dash of Calvados I added. The crust and topping were fast and easy though I did have to run it under the broiler for a minute or two to get the topping to brown. Then, golden and gorgeous. I'll definitely make it again.

I was very disapointed with the recipe. I thought the crust and topping were good. However, I thought the filling tasted funny. Maybe I just don't like the taste of dried apples.

I made this when the recipe was originally published a few years ago in Gourmet...I'm glad to find it again! The dried apples are nice, and provide great flavor to the tart, because you would never be able to pack as many fresh apples into a tart this size. Buy dried apples and keep them on hand to make this - regardless of whether apples are in season, you can have a tart with great apple flavor.

This was easy and tasty. Using the dried apples saved me alot of time and mess. I am making it again today, but this time sprinkling some dried cranberries in for color and a flavor twist.
