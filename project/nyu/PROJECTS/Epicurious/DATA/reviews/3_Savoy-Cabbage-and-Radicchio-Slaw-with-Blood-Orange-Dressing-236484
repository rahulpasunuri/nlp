i used spinach instead of the savoy cabbage and left out the mayo. i might try it with yogurt.

Very light dressing...nice. Used chopped dates instead of cranberries & vegenaise mayo instead of regular.:) Family loved it and had no clue it wasn't real mayo.

We made this for Thanksgiving. Wanted a change from the regular green salad. It was a smashing success. Only change I would make is to increase the amount of dressing. Blood orange juice found at Trader Joe's. They have fizzy and non fizzy...took the latter. Just the right amount of tang.

Looks great, but the flavor wasn't anything special... the citrus flavor was diluted with the mayo

Great dish to make for a potluck or a family crowd. I added an extra handful of the cranberries for sweetness.
