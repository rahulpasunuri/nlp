Worth the time and effort. This recipe can be halved, since the full size really is enormous.

This was great! Made this dessert for our Dinner Club. It was quite a bit of work to prepare but worth the work once you tasted it. I think next time I'll cut back a little on the Sherry, perhaps omit the last soaking of the sponge cake. Ingredients a little difficult to find and could become an expensive dessert. I substitutes "Amaretto" for the "kirsch" and used "crème Anglaise" instead of "crème fraîche". I used Cool Whip instead of whipping cream for final topping. If making this dessert, start it early in the day or better yet, the day before.

A great dessert in the old tradition especially if you are prepared to take the time and energy to make the custard from scratch. A word of warning, the recipe instructions leave out the part about cooking the custard after it reaches 170 degrees. Keep the custard at this heat for 30 minutes or until the misture thickly coats the side of the bowl. If after you cool it it is still to loose retirn it to the steam for further cooking. Don,t over heat or you end up with sherry flavoured scrambled eggs.
