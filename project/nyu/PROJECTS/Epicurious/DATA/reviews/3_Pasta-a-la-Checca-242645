I love Pasta a la Checca, especially with my home grown heirlooms. Instead of cherry tomatoes, I used my own Italian plum tomatoes, seeded and peeled. The sauce is not watery because the seeds have been removed. Plum tomatoes are very meaty, perfect for this recipe. I didn't have any arugula, so I used lots of fresh basil and tossed with dried red pepper for a kick and some pericino romano cheese. I like the feta & olive suggestion and I'll try the arugula next time.

This is an incredibly easy and tasty recipe. Nothing fancy but for a quick dinner (that included a guest that eats a vegan diet)it was perfect. As others recommended I added some basil to taste, with bowls of sliced kalamata olives and feta on the side to sprinkle on if desired. I also increased the arugula to two cups. I used spiral pasta not spaghetti. A definate keeper for nights when I don't want to spend much time cooking.

I thought (just being honest) that the tomato jucie from the tomatoes made the pasta a little runny. The juice wouldn't stick to the pasta and is like water (thin). It was OK nothing special AT ALL. Sure it was a quick dinner, but it isn't the best. (make something else!)

Delicious and easy with fresh ingredients, though agree that it needed a little something more than the recipe calls for. Used a sliced up regular tomato and arugula from our CSA. Took the recommendation of adding feta cheese and some cut up kalamata olives. Also sauted some fresh red peppers in garlic and added that to the mix (rather than using raw garlic with the tomatoes). Was a great hit.

This is a really good pasta salad. Which is essentially what it is. Ofcourse, for me it was a little too bland, so adding goat cheese crumbles were good with it or feta. Kalamata olives are also delicious. Very fresh and easy.

Made this with cherry tomatoes from the garden, double the arugula, and some fresh basil leaves thrown in for good measure. Excellent flavors and a great way to use up the garden bounty. A definite keeper.
