this recipe is good...but the trike is to chill the dough before you try to make it into balls for about 30 min. or so otherwise they will not form

chilling really made a huge difference in rolling out the balls....my husband loves them....i used caramel baileys instead of kahlua and it was quite tasty. this is however a finicky recipe...DONT USE TOO MUCH LIQUID, maybe add portions at a time so it doesnt get too liquidy

It is crucial to only use 5 ounces of evaporated milk with this recipe - I think folks who had difficulty forming balls may have used too much of the milk, so the mixture was too liquidy. If you only use the 5 oz., and refrigerate for a couple of hours before forming balls (and maybe re-refrigerate once in the middle) I found it easy to form into solid balls. The Kahlua to me didn't add much flavor - just made it that much more chocolately. I made half Kahlua, half Grand Marnier (and alternated putting the mix back into the fridge so that the mix stayed cold while forming into balls) and the crowd really loved the Grand Marnier. Next time, I'll do just that, and maybe some Chambord (yum!) and skip the Kahlua. Also subbed pecans for the walnuts (all I had). Since I'm not a coconut fan, I also skipped that step, as have other reviewers, and coated them in cocoa and powdered sugar instead. I made the balls much smaller than called for - all you need for this is a little taste. I got almost 100 balls out of the mix.

Very tasty and a breeze to make. I had no problems forming the balls, although I did: - Use 1.5 cups of each cookie. - Let chocolate/milk sit for 30 minutes. - Used Gran Marnier - Fridged the mixture for 40 minutes. - Rolled with slight-damp hands (fingertips in water). Kept some of the crumbs larger as it retained texture/crunchiness, and instead of coconut I rolled them in powdered raspberry (non-sugared).

I made this recipe for our company bake sale and got rave reviews - I even got requests to make it again this year. You definitely need at least 1-1/2 cups of each kind of cookie to give the dough enough body to maintain its shape. Don't skip the step of cooling the melted chocolate/milk mixture at least 30 minutes. Once I had combined all the ingredients, I refrigerated the dough for about 30 minutes before forming into balls, which may have helped.

Tastes great, but requires a huge amount of fiddling around to get it anywhere close to setting. Certainly doesn't work as balls!

I really enjoyed this recipe for liquer delicassies. Everyone at my Birthday party were asking where they could get the recipe.

I had leftover evaporated milk and coconut, and this is what came up from advanced search. I was cautious after reading reviews, but this recipe tastes very delicious. It is frustrating if you are trying to make a nice presentation for gift giving. I chilled the mixture for one hour before attempting to roll, an absolute necessity. Then I rolled the balls and put them on parchment to set in the freezer for 20 minutes before putting them in the cups. They are firm and taste great but they are not balls, they are mounds. I guess they still pretty in the paper cups. Also used a whole box of vanilla cookies--don't cheat and eat cookies before making crumbs, you will NOT have enough. The whole box just made the 2 1/2 cups plus extra 1/3 cup, which you really need. I would also consider using more confectioners sugar, which holds icing together so nicely, that would probably make them hold the shape better. I made the balls big and put them in cupcake liners. I thought that was making them not keep the shape, so made them smaller and they still don't keep ball shape well. I omitted the kahlua b/c i don't drink alcohol and used peanuts b/c I didn't have walnuts. I think the walnuts would taste more sophisticated though.

I used all vanilla cookie crumbs (gingerbread can be a bit greasy), and let the mixture set for 20 miuntes after it finished cooking. I added most of the coconut to the mixture so the goop would have a texture to stick to. They cooled on wax paper for approx 2 hours, and they were great!!

The mixture had to be cooled/firmed up in the fridge for about 20-30 minutes before rolling the balls and I did use the extra cookie crumbs. I'm sure the coconut looks pretty, but I don't like it so I rolled mine some in cocoa; some in powdered sugar and some in nuts. They went over well at a party I brought them to. Very rich.

Hello, I hope that woman's dog is okay -- chocolate kills them.

I suggest using only vanilla wafers and I used an entire box in one large bowl and slowly adding the choclate and kahlua. Letting the mix sit for 20 minutes to harden made rolling the balls easier. Finishing I rolled the balls in a deep round bowl of confection sugar. Since Kahlua is a dessert liquor you can use extra to taste. Go with your gut feeling of cooking and enjoy!

To make this recipe work I added at least 1/2 cup more cookie crumbs and let the dough sit for several minutes to firm-up before forming the balls. Also, I would suggest adding less liqueur than the receipe suggests, tasting the batter, and adding more only if necessary. Although I think these christmas balls taste better than most rum balls I have tried, and the coconut makes them festive, in the end they were merely average compared with all the other wonderful holiday dessert recipes out there.

Could NOT get it to thicken enough to roll into balls. No matter how much cookie crumbs were added. Made a big mess. The DOG thanks you though.

I kept adding more and more cookie crumbs to try to reach a consistency that formed a ball. It was a huge mess of chocolate dough & coconut. Although the dough does harden the longer it sits around.

I agree with the previous review. These did not turn out well at all -- very runny and not great flavor.

It is way too moist! Adding 1/3 cup more cookie crumbs didn't help. It's still too sticky to roll into balls. Don't make it.!
