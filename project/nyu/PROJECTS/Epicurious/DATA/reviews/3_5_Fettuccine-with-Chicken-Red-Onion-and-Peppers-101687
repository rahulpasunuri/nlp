this dish is a mess. a lot of work and not nearly worth the effort.

This dish ended up amazing because of one simple modification: added one pecorini pepper. It made the flavor so much more complex. I also used white wine instead of chicken broth, and sauteed the chicken in rosemary and garlic. I didn't end up needing cheese in the end, but I did add a bit of salt. Next time though, I'll be less inpatient and actually let the fettuccine cook all the way through.

Delicious. I tasted the dish before adding the cheese, and decided to serve with a few lumps of goat cheese instead of the jack. It melted in, contributing to the creaminess and adding a nice tang that worked well with the smoky heat of the chipotles. I used 2% milk with cornstarch, reduced, instead of the cream, as well - so that, with the goat cheese, had the added benefit of making it a lower-fat dish.

A lot of reviewers had issues with the fat. An effective & delicious way to replace cream is to use evaporated milk. Choose from non to low to whole. It pretty much keeps the body provided by cream, just less fat. Adding a splash of cream is help balance the flavors and is always good. Another issue is the chipotle. Chipotles ARE smoky! They are roasted jalapenos! Use chipotles in adobo, just rinse off the sauce if you don't like the taste. Finally, the best way to assemble is to add cream sauce to pasta, add cheese & stir until well mixed, then add veggies & meat. There are so many ways to alter this dish to meet your taste or to use the leftovers calling from the fridge.

This is very similar to a dish I used to order at the Red Robin in Seattle, WA. They took it off the menu and I have been hoping to find a similar recipe. This is as good or better than the dish I had there. The only change I made is melting all the cheese into the cream before adding the other ingredients. It was wonderful!

I loved the idea of this dish but was also not prepared to fatten it up with cream. I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 like another reviewer, but I found that after I let the dish heat all together and kept stirring, my sauce did thicken up (a little extra cheese does not hurt and you can use lower fat cheese). We loved the mix of different peppers, including the adobo canned chipotles which the recipe does call for. I also always use whole wheat pasta.

I made this to use fresh bell peppers and poblano chilies from the garden and thought this was a very good use of my peppers. I substituted fat free half and half for the cream and used jalapeno and Monterey Jack cheese. I did not use minced canned chipotle chilies because I could only find canned chipotle chilies with adobe sauce and I did not think the BBQ- flavored adobe sauce would work (a little too over powering). My boyfriend and I really liked this dish although my boyfriend said the dish could use another 1/4 cup of cilantro. The sauce did not thinken but it never does when I use FF 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream. In fact, I add the 1/2 and 1/2 last and heat just until warmed so it does not clump. The dish worked very well even without a thick (fattening) sauce.

Very tasty dish. I added 1 extra chipotle pepper and 1-2 extra garlic cloves. LOVED it!! Has a nice bite to it. probably did a little less cilantro though, not a big fan of it. I will make this again for sure!

I used to order this all the time at Art Geckos. They have since altered the recipe by adding mushrooms - and its not as good. This recipe is what got me started seeking out great food to make at home.

Bland? No way! I really enjoyed this recipe as is - just used half & half instead of cream. Squeeze some fresh lime juice over the sauce just before serving. Really lifts out the flavors from the cream. Tasty!!!!

This was delicious and easy to prepare, and not remotely bland. Don't cut back on the cilantro, as it is so fabulous with the chicken and red peppers and onions. Recipe as written is easy to make, and having omitted the poblano chiles for lack thereof (sub'd crushed red pepper), this was PLENTY spicy. Granted, I wasn't looking for a "southwestern" dish, just something yummy to make with chicken, pasta, red onion, red pepper and garlic; it was quick and great. HOWEVER, I could not imagine making this with 2 cups of cream -- turning an otherwise healthy dish into a heart-attack on a plate -- so I reduced a cup of 1% milk and a cup of chicken broth for a bit, and it was DEVINE. Tweak it a bit with common sense, and ENJOY!

Wonderful taste and wonderfully simple to make. Tastes great as left overs too! My only change would be...cut way back on the cilantro! A little cilantro goes a LONG way. The cilantro that the chicken is chilled in is plenty for the whole dish.

Nothing special. Agree with viewer below that it was bland.

I Love this recipe, I do change it a little though, somtimes I don't use the chicken or cilantro but use fresh sliced mushrooms that I cook with the other vegetables. So very tasty. The first time I had this recipe was at Art Gecko's in Circus Circus. I knew I must have this recipe.

Made this recipe in 2000 and was underwhelmed. Made it again this year and enjoyed immensely. Poblanos were hotter the second time and it made a huge flavor difference. Also I use FF Half and Half wherever cream is called for and this works well, with the occasional help of cornstarch. Thanks to all who gave tips on storing chipotle peppers!

I had forgotten about this recipe until someone mentioned it the other day. One of the things I have done differently is added roasted corn. It really adds a nice smokey flavor and brings out the southwestern style. And I've substituted the cream for a half milk/half sour cream mixture to make it a little less heavy.

How do I put this? Boring, bland, blah, etc. Based on all the rave reviews I thought I was going to end up with a new favorite but instead I was very disappointed. I detected no heat and I even put in extra chilies. We ended up seasoning it ourselves w/black and red pepper after it was dished up and it was STILL lacking "something." The flavors didn't seem to meld like it should. It's not worth the effort and I won't be making this again.

This was a little too hot for my family. I think I would make it again, but leave out the chipotles. I also used seitan, instead of chicken, and half and half cream with a tablespoon of cornstarch to thicken it, instead of whipping cream. It was certainly rich enough.

This was great. I used a white onion and threw in some sliced zucchini - both just fine. Instead of cream, I used 1% milk mixed with 2 Tbsp. cornstarch and that worked great. The poblano chili I added was mild, but those can be hot. We liked the amount of heat. Regarding the chipotle - to store, I simply put the remainder of the can in a clean glass jar (8 - 10 oz.) and tape the can's label around the outside of the jar. Better than Boullion jars are a good size. The chipotles keep in excess of a year in the refrigerator - I never let fingers touch the chilis or the adobado sauce.

This recipe is really different and great if you like southwestern food. The 2 cups whipping cream is heavy but I would definitely make it again.

This is very tasty. I made it with horn-shaped peppers & cheddar+ gruyere since poblano chili & Jack cheese are not available here. Also, when I want to make it milder, I reduce chipotles & add some Spanish smoked paprika.

Yum! I have made this lots of times and I have enjoyed each experience. I add fresh mushrooms to make it even better. I plan to make it next week for visiting relatives. It is just a very tasty dish and great way to use chicken.

Yum. I wouldn't change a thing. To store chipotles, here's my secret: 99% of all recipes call for them minced or pureed, so when I open a fresh can I puree the whole thing in the blender, and put the leftover puree in a medium zipper freezer bag. I spread it out in the bag so it freezes in a thin layer, then break off whatever size piece I need.

I made this dish for a dinner party of eight. The only adjustment I made was to add one more chicken breast and a cup of chicken stock to the sauce. There was plenty for everyone and it worked well to make the sauce early in the day and refrigerate it until an hour before showtime. Then I boiled the pasta, mixed in the sauce and popped it in the oven on 200 degrees until we were ready to eat when I added the final cheese and served. It was a hit and I was relaxed! I'd definately do it again.

I write in response to the storing chipotles question (although the recipe looks great and is on the "to make" list). To preserve chipotles: place them individually on an aluminum pie plate (or something similar) and freeze them until solid. Then, transfer them to a freezer container. In this manner you can use them on an as needed basis.

Wonderful recipe. I lightened it up by using 1 cup of cream and grating a small amount of cheese on top; and still I could have used more chipotle chilies.

This is my husband's and my favorite pasta recipe. I'm making it again tonight for the third time. We substitute whole-wheat bow tie pasta for the fettucine to stick to our "Sugar Busters" diet. It's terrific, but beware if you have children as it may be too spicy for them.

Bravo, Epicurious! We LOVE this dish; my 17 year-old son requests it but doesn't want to ask too often because he doesn't want to get sick of it. The flavors are fabulous and I WILL check out some Rick Bayless cookbooks, as one reviewer suggests. **I love the flavor of the chipotle chilies but how do you store them after you open the can? Can you freeze them, does anyone know?**

Love this dish! I usually add extra chipotles to make it extra spicy.

I made some changes to the recipe as well. I added two tomatillos (available at Latin American stores) to the vegetable mixture I sauteed. Also, I chopped all the vegetables instead of slicing them. I added TWO pasilla chiles that I grilled on my stovetop grill to the 1/2 cup of cilantro at the conclusion of the recipe. I also melted the cheese in the cream and chipotle mixture after it thickened. This was excellent, and you can adjust the chipotles to the level of spice you like!

This dish is wonderful. I substituted the peppers for just jalapeno peppers and used 2% milk instead of whipping cream. I have made this dish many times and love it every time.

This dish had wonderful flavors, it brought back memories of Santa Fe, but was a little on the hot side for my husband. Because the canned chipotles are extremely hot, I ommitted them completely and used just the sauce (half tbsp.) they came in. I roasted the poblano as well, but added only half of it. Substituting the cream with evaporated skim milk made no change in taste. This was a great recipe, but because of the heat I may try it next time with just poblanos and no chipotles. It does make a lot, so prepare for leftovers!

Have made this dish several times...it has always been met with rave reviews. I took someone elses advice and roasted some peppers which do add a great flavour. Cannot get poblanos here in the UK but never the less, with chipotles and all the other ingredients, and having to use cheddar instead of Monterey Jack which is unhead of here, this is still one of the best pasta dishes I have done...would recommend everyone to try it, especially if you love chipotles.

I followed the suggestions below, even made a couple other changes: replace half the jack cheese with gruyere and try using grilled or smoked chicken. Can't get to a grill in winter? A very small dash of Liquid Smoke will do. A good starting-point recipe with lots of possible variations.

Great recipe... Well received in my home... I even made it for guests... Just keep in mind that the poblano chilies can vary in "heat", so this can affect the overall outcome of this recipe...

Reduced fat evaporated milk or 2% milk may be substituted for the whipping cream and this dish is still delicious. I also tried it without the poblanos and chipotles (they are hard to find in a small town!). My husband loved it anyway. We liked it better re-heated--I guess the aging helps to meld the flavors. We have had it twice and will do it again!

I roasted my peppers, and onion. It goes great with the fettuccine. If you like this recipe check out the cookbooks from Rick Bayless. This dish is very reminiscent of the flavors in his books.

This dish was very good. The different types of chilies gave it a good flavor and make it very colorful dish. I did not sauté the chilies, instead I roasted the chilies. This brings out more the flavor and the texture of the chilies in the dish. Margarita

This is a great weeknight pasta dish. Very simple to make. I lightened it by using fat free evaporated milk and reduced fat cheese. I always use cooking spray and cut back on the vegetable oil by at least half. The dish was very flavorful and I don't think these substitutions compromised the recipe. My husband loved it, I would make it again.

The ridiculous grocery stores around here rarely have poblanos, so I omitted them as well as the chipotles. The recipe was really good, though. It was easy to make, but be careful with the shredded cheese as it can get clumpy if not served immediately. It is a good "base" you could do a lot with...you could add peas, bacon, other veggies...

We very much liked this recipe, but next time I would dice the poblanos rather than slice them. Long slices were a little too much of a good thing.

This is an excellent "adult" dish. It was a bit too spicy for my 10 year old. She said "It's very good Mom, but it's too spicy for me. It isn't hot like hot sauce, just too spicy." She tought I had put too much black pepper in it. For a family meal, you might want to substitute a dash of hot sauce for the chipotle peppers in the sauce. If you know of a milder pepper, use it. I also made the salad with cucumber and pineapple in simple syrup type dressing. The sweet helps cool down the heat from the peppers. My husband and I both get indigestion and heartburn fairly often, but this didn't cause either of us to have stomach discomfort. In the hour that the chicken marinated, I did the rest of the slicing, etc., got the pasta water boiling, and prepared garlic bread for the broiler. Dinner on the table in about an hour and 20 minutes. I would definitely make it again.
