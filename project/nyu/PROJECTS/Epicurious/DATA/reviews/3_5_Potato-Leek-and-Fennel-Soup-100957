I thought this recipe looked wonderful as is but I can never let well enough alone. I added a Gala apple, roasted garlic and used garlic infused olive oil instead of butter. Additionally, half the potatoes I used were sweet potatoes. I like trying to use vegetables that are very healthy. It was really good with the sweetness of the apple and sweet potatoes. However the sweet potatoes may have overwhelmed the fennel. I will probably try it with just regular potatoes next time. I used to make a potatoe leek soup that called for red pepper flakes and that made a nice addition but with sweet potatoes, this was all I needed.

I followed the recipe exactly and loved the finished result. I served it with a bread filled with chorizo, two cheeses and three fresh herbs. The mildness of the soup was a perfect match for the boldness of the bread.

I made this tonight and like most other reviewers, I made some modifications as follows (I admit I went a little nuts). I added 1 large onion, diced into very small pieces, as well as one bunch of scallions and a whole clove of garlic. Topped off very sparingly with some bacon bits. I don't like fennel too much so I skipped that but the flavor was just right for a winter night when my household was down with a cold.

This recipe is delicious just the way it is written. Those who suggest jazzing this soup up with garlic and Worcestershire and other additions are missing out on a wonderfully subtle and delicately flavored soup.

I used my fresh veggies from our CSA. Loved it! The only thing I changed was I added some chopped garlic, probably a clove or 2 worth. Delicious and so creamy!

Wow, I love this soup. I followed the suggestion of several reviewers and ended up with fantastic results. I sauted yellow onion and lots of garlic (I love garlic) and then added the leek and fennel. I had some carrots that needed to be used up so I added them with the red potatoes. I used homemade chicken stock that I had on hand as well. Added some sea salt and black pepper and blended. I haven't used fennel before but had some from my weekly CSA box and am so glad I found this recipe. Delicious! I topped with yummy greek yogurt. I'll be eating this all week!

This is a good base. Even with three cloves of garlic and an extra onion I found the soup to lack dimension and flavor. At the very end I also added a dash of Worcester Sauce and that made all the difference. You can't tell what changed but it adds a complexity that makes everything quite tasty!

I really wish I'd read the other reviews before following this recipe. As is, the soup is very bland. I've added some cayenne, which helped, but it would have been much better with garlic and shallots as suggested by another reviewer.

I read the reviews, and added 3 cloves of crushed garlic, increased the leeks to 2 and 3/4 cups and the potatoes to 5 cups. It was sensational. Very creamy and rich. Using the stick blender in the pot saved tons of time and effort. I will definately make this again and again.

I was looking for a potato soup to accompany a spicy deli sandwich when I logged on and found this one. I made it and was not disappointed in its mild, flavorful taste. I plan to make it again.

We added fresh lemon juice, white wine, parmesan, 1/4 tsp of cayenne, and a lot of parsley. with additions it was delish.

I thought this soup was pretty good. I added a little cream at the end and it came out pretty tasty. Also used a hand held blender because, duh, it's easier. Added some chives and yum!

This soup is just not that exciting...kinda bland actually. A MUCH better recipe is the Creamy Fennel and Potato Soup.

Rating: 3
I also added two cloves of garlic, and about 1/2 cup of white wine, and used olive oil (instead of butter) to sautee, as well as vegetable broth instead of chicken. The garlic and veggie broth (Better Than Boullion) were very strong and almost overwhelmed the fennel- next tim, I might use more fennel and dilute the broth a bit.

Rating: 3
This is excellent soup - I think I will kick it up a bit next time though by adding a bit less of the broth and a bit more of the leeks and fennel as I really love their taste. This is a great winter time soup though. I also used a hand held blender (cuisinart) to puree the soup right in the pot - as having to transfer in batches to a blender seemed like a crazy amount of additional work.

I know that some get wary of reviews that includes significant changes. So divert your eyes. I learn a lot from the creative variations and think that it is just fine to use the printed recipe as a guide or an idea. To provide more layers of flavor, I added shallots and a couple of garlic cloves. For complexity, I sautéed the vegetables until they started to caramelize, deglazed with a herb based liquor. Then I simmered in the stock with just enough potatoes to provide needed texture, but not to dilute the flavors of the fennel. Before serving, I added a touch more of the liquor. The soup was complex and wonderful. As one of my guests said, there is a beginning, a middle and a finish.

Have made this a couple times and it is very good. A bit subtle in flavor, I added crumbled gorgonzola cheese and a few croutons to the top as I serve and pass fresh ground pepper to bring out the fennel.

I agree with most of the other reviews; that is, good soup, nothing special. Adding cheese and big garlic croutons made it really nice. I used a quattro fromaggio (provolone, parmesan, asiago and fontina) sprinkled on top after ladling up. I'm wishing I'd remembered to add the garlic as suggested, and a little vino. Next time...

This soup is deeelish! It's important not to brown the veggies. I added 2 cloves of garlic with the leeks, and fresh thyme for garnish.

I have made this recipe a number of times and have enjoyed it, but it lacked something.. I use homemade turkey stock, a diced onion & 4 minced garlic cloves. However, the ingredient that made it great was a tbsp of crumbled (small crumbles) blue cheese over each serving. This improved it greatly... Will definitely do it this way again. I haven't tried other cheeses sprinkled on top, but parmesan may be preferential to those who don't like blue cheese.

Okay - I too made some "corrections" to this soup. I added an onion and some shallots with the leeks. Then I added 1 teaspoon dried thyme + 1 teaspoon dried tarragon + 1/4 cup pernod just when the leeks were done being sauted (before added in the stock). After all said and done with the pureeing I then added a splash of lemon juice. This folks was delish!

A simple, comfort-type soup. I found it somewhat bland, so I added salt, pepper and lemon juice. My teenager liked it; my husband's comment was "Tastes like the filling in a chicken pot pie."

I really liked the balance of flavors in this soup, but I added dill to refresh it. I also cheat and use Campbell's Chicken Broth 1/1 with water to add flavor.

I thought this looked like a wonderful recipe, and it was tasty enough, but I don't think I'd make it again unless I happened to be trying to use up fennel and leeks. I used a generous amout of black pepper to add some zing, but still flavor came up short, maybe adding some cream might make it a little more appealing.

This dish was a huge hit. It cooks up quickly and except for the food processing, is not terribly labor intensive. I whole-heartedly agree with the cook from New Mexico: adding sour cream and some fennel fronds adds both color and flavor. I would also recommend the generous addition of fresh black pepper.

This has got to be the best Potato Soup I have ever had. I think it must be the addition of the Fennel to the recipe.

Wonderful recipe. I used russet potatoes instead of red potatoes. Fennel was there in just the right amount - just perfect!

Made this for Passover based on other reviews and was expecting something with a little taste. Boring, boring, boring. Not worth the short time it takes.

This is a wonderful soup. I pureed all of it, but first pureed a small amount with a handful of the fennel fronds and a dollop of sour cream, then added it to the rest. It intensified the fennel taste and the result was a rich, creamy soup. I used a couple of 32-oz boxes of organic chicken broth, which is much richer than the canned stuff and it doesn't have MSG.

I loved this soup when it was first finished. I also added shallots and a yellow onion. The fennel mellows very nicely so that there is not a strong anise flavor. However, I made it the night before and by the time I served it the fennel flavor was gone and the soup was gritty. Definitely make it just before serving.

I agree that the fennel definitley gives this soup a great flavor. I put a hand held blender into the soup pot and blended it lightly. It gave the soup a bit more texture, which I like.

This was a great soup - I've never used fresh Fennel before. It was hard to cut, but it cooked nicely. I did make some changes to the recipe - I used half vegetable broth (two cans) and 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2. I also added another two tablespoons of butter - yes, the rich version!!! Also, I used brown potatoes and left the skin on (my preference). Anyway, it was a wonderful soup!!!

I served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it. Very easy to make, and the fennel bulb gives it a wonderful flavor.

Loved it! I improvised a fair amount--I had no fennel so I substituted it with dill and basil; I used white onions instead of leeks; at the end, I added 1/3 half and half. Voila La!

I have been craving potato soup and my husband just groaned cause he has always had this type of soup with little or no flavor. He is a gardner and he's already looking forward to me making this soup again with his own fresh veggies from the garden. We will be making this soup again and again!!!

Fennel is one of my favorite vegetables. So this was, of course, a hit. I used the food processor on pulse. a few times, to get a good texture. (mentioned in other reviews).

My family loved this soup. I didn't have any leeks, so I substituted 1/2 white onion. It was wonderful. The second time I made it, I did not use the blender, I used a potato masher to get some texture in the soup - even better!

This is good stuff, I love the fennel (my new favorite vegetable) but pureeing makes it sort of starchy. I like it better like this: Instead of pureeing the soup, shred the potatoes in the food processor with the peels still on and just leave it be. This is great with a little bit of cream stirred in at the last minute.

Best potato and leek soup I've made. Not sure if this is because of the fennel or home-made stock. Everyone loved it!

This was wonderful and will be a staple among my recipes. The second time I served it, I added two cans of Gorton's minced clams. This was a big hit as well.
