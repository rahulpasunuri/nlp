Added fresh basil to the sauce, and it was delish.

I liked this recipe enough to try it out on my boss. We're both cooks at a busy diner in Whistler, B.C., breakfast is soo important before a big day of sking up here, and nothing cures a hang-over quite like eggs benedict. My thoughts on this recipe? Chose quality cuts of ham, the richer the smokiness the better. The tomatoes, grill them to a soft and slightly caramelized state. If you can make the hollandaise sauce with mushroom infused oil, your have more than a few people wanting to have breakfast at your place(of work that is).

Simply divine! If you are a dressed up eggs benedict fan, you will love this dish! Something about the ham/egg/sauce combo is really yummy. My only complaint is that it is really not necessary for this recipe to take this long to make. Once I roasted the tomatoes and mushrooms in advance, I made the sauce and then put the whole thing into a tupperware and nuked it in the microwave while the eggs were cooking. I also toasted the bread in the toaster and nuked the ham for 20 seconds or so. This made the dish super easy and great for a casual weeknight.

This is pretty, easy and very good. I did not put the egg on a paper towel. I used a plastic spatula to take egg out of pan and then tilted as much water off and then put the spatula on the paper towel for a couple of seconds. It seemed to work as my egg wasn't watery on the plate. I used boursin cheese, we don't have fontina. Also only had scallions on hand instead of chives. I cooked quite a bit longer, but still had a nice runny egg.

Once I saw Martha S. make poached eggs and she drained them on a slice of bread (not to be eaten obviously). I don't know if that would be easier than removing them from paper towel. Just a suggestion.

Delicious, and easy! Next time I would add garlic to the tomato and mushroom roast, and puree it with the tomatoes as well.

Answer to question: How do I drain the eggs with a paper towel? I cup the slotted spoon with a folded paper towel to absorb water from the bottom of the egg, then gently blot the top and sides of each egg, in the spoon, as needed to remove all droplets.

My husband has spent many of his birthdays in the British Isles, so I picked this recipe as a birthday breakfast. It's a good recipe, but following it exactly, I could not remove a poached egg from the paper towel without breaking it. Any other ideas on how to drain the egg?

I made this for my boyfriend this weekend and he loved them! The only thing we thought might improve them was if we added cheese. Although I accidently broke a couple of the yokes while poaching the eggs, they still worked. Not half as pretty as the ones in the magazine, but very yummy! We'll probably have them next weekend, too! Thanks!
