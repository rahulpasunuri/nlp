The best result for this fab cookie Butter left out overnight to be of a really smooth consistency ,egg at room temperature and the sugar really needs to be castor sugar. The buttermilk is good straight from the fridge. For me made 12 good sized cookies beautifully smooth and rounded.

If your mixture is of the right consistency, no need to spread, the oven heat does it all.

This is a great recipe and makes a very authentic cookie! I made some tweaks to the icing - I didn't use the corn syrup (although it probably gives the icing a bit more shine) and added a little milk instead of water. I used cocoa power as called for in the recipe; however, next time I'd try using high quality melted dark chocolate. I think that would give a deeper chocolate flavor. I also made my cookies a bit smaller, using about 1/8 cup of batter per cookie. I'd suggest spreading out the batter slightly, but not too much because you want them to be thick. Delicious!

Interesting about the icing, you need to make your own fondant mix of boiled glucose,sugar and water. Then mix to a good consistency with rest of ingredients, does not make cookies soggy and will keep - but who wants to keep and not eat.

FAGETABOUTIT! I have my own receipe for Black & White cookies that I make at home. Comes out superb ... but, if you want the BEST store boughten ... GO to ZAROS in Grand Central Station, NY. My wife and I bought four (4) last night to go home with on the train. They were the best. Two for the train and two for the freezer, when we get home ... if they last that long. P.S. They did! They're in the freezer. Can't wait.

Firstly, the cookie part was great. Light, cakey, and delicious. BUT, as others noted, the icing was terrible! Soapy and almost inedible. I regretted frosting them all before I sampled the icing, because they were essentially ruined :(. I will make this again, but with a different icing recipe.

Rating: 3
They taste good, BUT whoever wrote this recipie leaves out a LOT of information. If you are unfamiliar with the black and white, as I am, then you will have to first riun a batch before you realize these things do not spread in the overn and that you have to spread them yourelf before baking or you end up with cookies that look like muffins. You also need to drop the batter in a crumpet ring first to get the perfectly round shape shown in the picture. You must carefully smooth out the batter and take care not to tap it as this will result in dents in the finished product. You also should not bake the cookies nearly as long as she says to. A tasty cookie hard fought from a recipie with severely lacking instructions. I will likely make again as a friend from NJ is missing them, but this is definitely not a recipie for a southern girl to follow.

I love black and white cookies and these are fantastic. This made closer to 6 cookies for me, not 8. And instead of buttermilk, I used a milk/lemon juice substitute. Other than that, I followed everything else exactly and it turned out great, and the cookie was perfect. I've read several complaints about the frosting but I think it actually works well with the cookie; love the lemon in the white frosting. Would definitely make again, probably doubling the recipe!

AMAZING! I put a little too much water in the icing so it stayed a little sticky (I'll do better next time, and there WILL be a next time with this one). The cookies were light and fluffy and I made two batches and they both came out perfect so I know that it's a sturdy reliable recipe. The icing is a little tricky, but I'm sure with practice it'll be perfect too. Thank you so much for sharing this with me.

This is the second recipe I have tried for B&W cookies. On Allrecipes.com they have a recipe that is very dry and not flavorful at all. So far this one is far superior. A few adjustments that I made according to many comments are the following: -instead of 1/3 c. of butter add a 1/2 c. -instead of 1/3 c. of buttermilk add a 1/2 c. as well -I put 1/4 lemon in cookie batter...per another recipe. I didn't mind it I might just put 1/8th next time. -REDUCE LEMON flavoring in icing to 1/4!!! Unless you really like lemon. -I coated my fingers with spray pan coating and smoothed the cookies into two inch circles. I also lightly coated the pan with spray. -For the icing I made two batches. -Vanilla icing: Make the regular recipe except use milk or cream instead of water to make it more opaque. -Chocolate icing: I used the double boiler method and put 1/4 c. of semisweet Ghiradelli morsels; about a 1/2c. of confectioners sugar; 1 T of lght corn syrup; 1 T of water; and 1/4 t. of vanilla. It tasted good. I only cooked the cookies for 10 minutes and they were done. They were fluffy and tasty.

I didn't make the cookies, only the icing. I used to live north of NYC and thought I knew of all the delicacies that the City has to offer. But before we went there recently, a friend asked me to find these cookies for her. I looked all over, except never made it into Dean & Deluca. Should have gone in because I heard they are the best. Anyway, found them in NJ. I really didn't care for them. They're cakey and nothing special. Maybe you had to grow up with them... But I wanted to give some to my friend, so gave her a couple of store-bought ones, and my version. I used my best sugar cookie recipe and iced them with this icing recipe and a little bit of coarse white sparkling sugar on the white side only. VERY, very good. My friend liked mine much better. I made 2 mistakes, which I'll correct next time. 1) Didn't ice the back (would make it more flat) 2) Used dark chocolate chips in place of powder. This is not good beings you've also used water and lemon juice. It sets up too quickly and doesn't "ice" the cookie. Make sure you use the cocoa powder. I know my cookies weren't "authentic", but they tasted great and looked awesome.

I made a vegan version of these cookies that was tasty and very different from the cookies I usually make; this is a cakey, iced cookie with a texture very similar to a pancake. Next time I think I will increase the amount of baking soda and sift the dry ingredients to get a lighter, fluffier cookie.

These cookies are amazingly delicious! I love the lemony zest the white side provides. The frostings balance each other well. Only difference I made, I didn't have buttermilk so I mixed one half 1% milk with half non-fat plain yogurt. These cookies are best the next day after they have completely cooled and frosting sets. I wouldn't make minis of this cookie. Big size is better for flavor.

This recipe is a good one except use vanilla, not lemon to flavor the glaze. This is about the closest a home baker will ever be able to get to making a true Black and White cookie. I say that because every Black and White cookie I have ever eaten was glazed with fondant - what you may think of as candy fondant (not rolled fondant). When I worked as a pastry chef we bought fondant in 5 pound tubs. We carefully and slowly heated it up on the stove and used it to dip petit fours, cover Napoleons, as a coating over marzipane covered cakes, etc. You can't get a black and white cookie that tastes or even looks right (with that beautiful shiny white sheen), without fondant. You can make fondant but it is very time consuming. First you have to heat sugar, corn syrup, and water to 240 F. degrees. Then you have to allow the mixture to cool for about 2-3 minutes. Then you work it until it turns white. Basically you take a wooden paddle and keep turning the sugar making a figure 8 until it turns white and you can no longer pull the paddle through it. This takes about 8-10 minutes. Then you have to wet your hands and start kneading until it becomes soft and smooth. After you have the fondant in a smooth ball you can melt it to use as a coating or candy drops or you can roll it to use it as a base for candy making. It should never be heated above 140 F. degrees. Fondant stores well, can be flavored with any flavor or made chocolate by adding melted chocolate to it. Having said all of that, this recipe is the closest you can come to a black and white without a fondant glazed top.

The cake part was right on, but the icing was way too lemony. It really ruined it. Next time I may use just a few drops or none at all.

Haven't tried this recipe yet, but it looks suspicious. Serious b&w cookie eaters know that the really authentic ones have a paper thin layer of apricot jam under the frosting (almost invisible, and only serves to give a hint of acidity and tanginess to the cookie). Gotta keep searching I think...

I am a NY girl living in California and I love black and whites but havent found the "good kind" in Los Angeles. Until now. These are great. I made this recipe but mini ones. The big ones taste better because they better capture the cakeiness of the recipe. These are truly delicious and authentic tasting and even better than some store bought because you make them fresh. Only way I diverted from recipe was reduced to 1 tsp fresh lemon juice (dont like too lemony) and used hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder - -what they had in the store. The frosting was great, very authentic. Consume the day you make them -- not as good after or frozen -- which really ruins them. Have patience with the frosting. It all worked.

These are lovely. You can make them smaller if you want to get more out of the high-concept recipe. Also, give yourself time to decorate if it's for an important event (it's hard at first to get the icing right). I did this for a black-and-white theme party and rued not having practiced first. For instance, you can scrape the backs with a butter knife to remove loose crumbs-it makes for an even coat.

I wasn't particularly thrilled with this recipe. The cookies came out just fine, they were moist and had a cake like quality. I also really enjoyed the lemon flavour in the icing.

I absolutely love cookies, and these are one of my favorites. Standard recipe is great, next time I'll adjust the icing, it's a little sweet. An offset knife helped with frosting, one color at a time so the first side sets before starting the next color. A tablespoon cookie scoop resulted in perfect size cookies.

I grew up in Queens and I often find myself missing the foods that Rhode Island seems to lack. Good pizza, Chinese food, bagels and these cookies. Now, in exchange for 4 hours of my time, I can at least get these cookies... They taste great. The cake is spot on. As for the icing... I needed to add more water and I needed to heat it a bit, because I found that, made as directed, the icing was a hard block and couldn't be spread. Mmm. Very good, though I'm not sure if it's worth the time--maybe next time I go to the city I'll buy a bunch.

This cookie was easy to make, well worth the effort. I used a 4oz ice cream scooper and got 6 prtfect cookies, the icing is perfect also. Then doubled the ingredients and used a 2oz scooper for smaller cookies for a crowd and they were a tremendous hit This is a keeper.Memories of walking down a manhatten street. This recipe did not disapoint and I am thrilled to have found it.Thank you for memories of living in NYC.

Just did these as a trial run for a black and white party I'm helping host in a couple weeks. Excellent cookies! The edges did turn brown, so I think I'll turn my oven down to 325 next time. As for icing, I think dutch process cocoa is the way to go. I tried the recipe with less than 1/4 cup and it was just too sweet. I do recommend halving the amount of lemon juice, and since mine were definitely brown and white cookies, I might fiddle with food coloring to try making them truly black.

Moist cookie/cake, excellent white frosting. But the chocolate portion of the frosting is a little "cocoa-y" for me. Maybe would be better if some bittersweet chocolate was used instead?

I moved to Manhattan about a month ago, and, unfortunately, the first week I was here I ate one black and white cookie per day from Tal's Bagels on First and 52nd. They are the most addictive and delicious baked thing I'd ever eaten. Tender, cakey cookie, firm yet creamy icing. Also unfortunately, Tal's is not close to my apartment. Hence I began a frenzied quest for an equally good B&W. I have been looking for a month, and none that I've tasted has come even close to being as good as the ones that I had from Tal's (even the famed Zabar's). Either the cookie part was too dry or thin or the icing was too sweet or hard, or the cookie just wasn't fresh enough. I love to bake, so I tried this recipe as written. Perfection. Know who makes the best B&W cookies in Manhattan now? Me. Well, and Tal's.

These cookies were perfection! I'd been searching for a recipe that replicated the delightful cookies I'd eaten in NY (and have since paid friends to smuggle to me). I'd been very disappointed by other recipes, but these cookies were cakey & fabulous. Small changes I made: I added slightly more milk to the batter; I spread the batter into rounds on the cookie sheet; and I made the icings using only powdered sugar and water, adding melted chocolate chips to make the chocolate icing.

I am from western ny where these cookies are called half moons, but essentially taste the same as black and whites. I'm not a fan of the intensely sweet icing used in local bakeries for this cookie, so I was a slacker and used store bought frosting instead. The same delicious traditional cookie underneath but not as sweet on top. I also made a few all vanilla "full moons" for a chocolate intolerant relative and some all chocolate "no moons" just for me. This recipie only yeilded six as I attempted to recreate the bakery giants I'm used to, so double it if you want them to last longer than a few hours.

I would definitely make more icing than the recipe called for. I ate a couple plain cookies because there just wasn't enough frosting to go around, of course that might have been because certain people in my house kept stealing spoonfuls of icing while I frosted the cookies. Either way, a little extra icing isn't hard to make and it will be used.

My husband is originally from Long Island and he loves this recipe. It reminds him of his childhood. I find the best way to make the cookies is to use an ice cream scoop. I got a great one from Williams Sonoma that measures out exactly 1/4 cup. I also cook mine on one of those stone cooking sheets from Pampered Chef. The cookies don't burn and come out perfect everytime. The only problem I have is the icing. I'm still trying to perfect it. I find the recipe for the icing is too little so I have to make 1 1/2 of the recipe, otherwise I run out of icing.

Rating: 4
If cookies are not as flat as you'd like (too much like a biscuit) add more buttermilk next time. With the right consistency, the dough automatically shapes itself to perfect roundness during its first few seconds in the oven; you can truly forget about having to shape them when applying them to the cookie sheet! This technique usually results in a quicker-baking cookie, and I found 9-11 minutes to be a more accurate timing range for the baking.

Rating: 4
The process for creating the cookie dough can be simplified: there is no need for a mixer and there is no need for more than one mixing bowl. The process is as follows: make sure the butter is heated (microwave is fine) so the outer surface has already melted; combine the butter sugar and egg and use a wire whisk to mix; add the buttermilk and vanilla and whisk again (do not be upset by the strange gritty texture that results); then add the flour bsoda and salt and use the whisk or a slotted spoon to finish the mixing. With this approach, you can reach the same level of smoothness that you'd get with a mixer, but with no need for the alternating-batch nonsense.

As a native New Yorker, I found these to be very much like the traditional black and white cookie. I made these as a mini version, and a double batch of dough only yielded 36 cookies. I may add a bit more butter next time, at least for minis, as the cookies were very high, but they did have the correct cake like quality. I used the pastry bag to shape them, otherwise it would be very difficult to get a nice round shape. Use only half the lemon juice stated for the icing. Getting the consistency of the icing is important, it has to be thinned just enough to spread on the cookie, otherwise it will run and the white will be translucent. Too thick and it won't have that nice shine. I used a butter knife to spread on the icing and it worked very well, even on the minis. I will definitely make these again.

They were perfect and tasted just like the ones from my favourite bakery in New York. And pretty easy to make too.

After reading the reviews on the shape of the cookies, I took a sheet of parchment paper, traced a circle shape based on the size I wanted (a drinking glass worked for a smaller size), then flipped the parchment paper over so the pencil side was down. I spooned the dough onto the traced circle and flattened to the size of the circle. Worked for me, plus easy clean up!

Made these for the first time over the weekend. Taste was fine, icing turned out well, but the shape! Definitely looked like biscuits, even with some flattening before I put them in the oven. Also, the texture was more biscuit-like than cake-like, not sure why. The only change I made to the recipe was leaving out the lemon juice, based on other reviewers comments. Can anyone suggest how to achieve a "lighter" outcome?

I flattened the mounds of batter just a little as I put them in the oven so the cookies did not mound up too much. Be sure that your oven does not cook them higher than 350 degrees, or the edges will become thin and overbrown. I didn't use the lemon juice and the icing came out fine.

I thought this recipe was very good. Easy to follow and the taste of the cookie is very similar to a real Black & White. No problems with the icing as other reviewers have said, although I think the Dutch process cocoa is a must. I used regular and it doesn't taste right. If you wait just a few minutes for the first icing to dry, you can get very nice straight lines. My cookies look great even if the chocolate taste is different.

THese are fabulous cookies! I amended a little, based on others' comments and my own lack of ingredients. I used skim milk instead of buttermilk...less fat & cookies are still fabulous! Also, I started the icings in 2 separate batches, so I could play with ingredients for each 1/2. I divided amounts in half AND: For white icing, I used 1/2 the lemon juice, a pinch of Cream of Tartar, and no corn syrup. For choclate 1/2, I used no lemon juice, Grade B maple syrup instead of corn syrup, and 2 tbsp. melted bittersweet choclate. This flavor combiunation was fantastic...and a little different than the traditional B&W cookie. I also dished onto my cookie sheet w/ a 2-tbsp. measuring spoon, alomst full, for smaller cookies. As I will be making again to bring to a cocktail party, I will probably use my 1 tbsp. measure to make tiny, bite-sied versions.

I'd say that this recipe is a good start but it needs tweaking. The problems that I had were that the cookies were too domed and the frosting was a pain to get to the right consistency. Next time I'll try flattening the cookies before baking them and I'll also chill them so that the shapes are pretty. I'll use hot water for the icing and instead of using cocoa powder I'll use melted chocolate. To get the icing to look perfect, I'll take a strip of parchment to get the edge straight for the white icing, let the white icing set a bit, and then do the same for the black frosting.

Very interesting.... I just bought Martha Stewart Holiday Cookies (2005) and the recipe is almost identical. The only difference in the cookie is 1/2 tablespoon butter (5 1/2 T versus 6T) and the icing is very close. Be that as it may, the recipe is great and I am making it again today. My only complaint is the icing and I am going to try some of the suggestions in the reviews. Only use clear vanilla in the white icing or it will be beige. The cocoa powder did not make the chocolate side the traditional black. Rather than black and whites it was beige and brown. But the flavor was fantastic!

My mom grew up in Brooklyn but now lives in Buffalo, NY where it is impossible to get authentic black and whites. So, every time I would run across any in my travels, I made sure to buy some for her. Well, I decided it was time to figure out how to make them on my own. I tried this recipe for her, and they came out exactly right. I halved the lemon juice, and everyone was still confused at the lemon taste, so next time I will leave it out entirely. I also think the 1/4 cup is too small for these cookies which are normally giants. I doubled the recipe, and ran out of frosting way before I ran out of cookies, so I would also suggest making more frosting than you think you'll need.

Unlike many of the other reviewers, I don't have any memories connected to black and whites, having grown up in Florida. After a recent trip to NYC, I brought home a box of black and whites from Zabar's and my kids loved them. I thought a homemade version would be even better and it was. However, I would liken the taste of these cookies to frosted pancakes--from the overwhelming buttermilk flavor. Great for kids, but not for the adults in my house. I will make them again for the kids, but will double the recipe next time.

I made these today and they do not come out like round cookies..they are more like biscuts. My family thought they were biscuts when they saw them. How do you get them to look like cookies? Every pic. I see of Black and Whites they are round cookies. The dough is sticky so you can't push it down it will stick to whatever took you are using. They do not flatten in the oven like choc.chip, etc. If anyone has adivce--pass it along.

As a native Brooklyn New Yorker, I can attest to the authenticity of these cookies, they are fabulous. The only change I made was to reduce the lemon juice in the icing by 1/2. Just like the old days.

These are Great!! and it will save me a lot of $$$$ on air fares to New York.. but I did take out the lemom juice, I did not like the taste that just me.

Delicious. I quadrupled the recipe (I was making them for a crowd!) and found that I needed a splash more buttermilk to get the batter the right consistency. In the icing, I used water and regular vanilla and had no trouble with the color changing. I thought the white icing was perfect, but I'd add less cocoa powder to the "black" icing -- it was a little overwhelming and noticeably less sweet than the white side.

I have made this recipe about six times and loved the results each time. The result is a very delicious, attractive cookie. My only (small) complaint is that these cookies rise quite high in the middle and don't spread much, resulting in a smaller diameter cookie than I have had from the bakery. I will try adding more buttermilk as suggested by another reviewer. Also, I was wondering about doubling the recipe as mine are eaten so fast and I noticed someone said they had success doing this. Love reading everyone's reviews - happy baking!!

Finally, a black and white that is the real deal. This a great standard recipe. The Frosting performs terrifically and looks just like the bakers'. Next time, I will put 1/2 the lemon juice that the recipe asks. I also added orange peel. Turned out great!

Be careful if you're on a low-carb regimen because no willpower in the world will stop you from devouring these once they're done. I know...I just blew mine! (on to the treadmill for me) Absolutely delicious cookies! The real deal as they say. My only other recommendation would be to make two batches! ;)

I was born in Rockland County New York and every Sunday after church we would go to the bakery for black and whites, and all kinds of other pastries. Black and Whites were always my favorites. When we moved to New Jersey we couldn't find a bakery near our home that could compare to the black and whites we were used to. This recipe is exactly the black and whites our bakery made. I love them, followed the recipe exacty and had no problems. We ate them 2 hours after they were finished and they were great. I had one with coffee this morning and it was even better. I wouldn't change a thing.

I am originally from the suburbs of New York City and these cookies rule in the bakeries there. This recipe matches the best of the best and I can never make enough of them either in frequency or quantity. Thanks Gourmet for another fabulous recipe!

FIVE stars! These are so close to the B&W's my grandparents would bring for us from Brooklyn when I was a kid. Anyone who gave this recipe a negative review either didn't follow the recipe properly or has never had a real B&W. The only change I recommend is adding some lemon zest to the batter - they should have an almost imperceptible hint of lemon to them. The only other change I made, thanks to other reviewers, was to use milk and clear vanilla in the icing. No problem with marbling if you just wait for the first color to dry. So good!

definitely leave out the lemon juice it doesnt add anything. Also dont put vanilla in the white icing it changes the color. Look for clear vanilla if you want the flavor.

This recipe was great! They definitely remind me of the cookies I used to buy at my favorite NY bakery. I replaced the water in the icing with milk and put half of the lemon juice into the batter after reading other the comments. I'll make these again soon!

I made these as directed, but substituted semisweet chocolate for the cocoa. The white icing tasted raw at first, but the rawness wore off by the second day. You can eliminate it altogether by using hot evaporated milk instead of water, but the icing won't be as white.

As a native New Yorker who grew up eating these cookies, this recipe is GREAT, and I must take issue with some of the negative comments. After reading the reviews I was a bit worried about the icing for the cookies, but, I followed the recipe as it was written with the one exception of adding milk to the white icing. For those who have never had a B&W cookie, they are ICED cookies, not frosted. Frosting such as for a cupcake is totally innappropriate for this cookie. The icing should be sugary, almost too sweet, and it's best the next day after it has had time to harden a bit. My one suggestion if your having difficulty with the icing, is use very little liquid as the cornstarch in the confectioners sugar makes it appear too dry at first, but if you let it rest you can see it glisten and melt. And to prevent marbling, ice all cookies with one color, and then, starting with the first ones you iced, the second color. The first will have hardened enough to prevent them from mixing. Enjoy!

I made these for a party, and followed the advice below regarding the icing, perfection! I tinted the white blue and pink (baby shower) and made them a little smaller. I plan on doing the same around the holidays. And for the reader who has never had a REAL black and white (you poor thing!)these come pretty close to what my dad used to bring me home from NYC!

I made these cookies and the bottom is great. I decided to use my own reciepe for the icings after reading the reviews. So for the chocolate I used 1 cup Semisweet morsels and 1 Tablestpoon of crisco shortning melted in a double boiler. For the white 2 1/2 cups confectioners sugar and 3 tablespoons of 1/2&1/2 or milk, stir with a wisk until smooth. more or less milk to get the right spreading consitency. I also made some cookies with all white and swirled the chocolate on top.

Rating: 4
I gave this cookie 4 forks ONLY with the icing that I made. Here's what I did, and I'd highly recommend you do it too. 4 cups confectioners sugar 1/3 cup boiling water 1 square semisweet chocolate 2 tsp cocoa powder a bit of extra water Stir boiling water into icing sugar one tbsp at a time until it's thick yet smooth. Put half the mixture into the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Put chocolate and cocoa in and stir until melted. You might need to add a bit of water at this point to thin it as the chocolate tends to thicken it up. This icing was far superior than the one on this website (which I've made before).

Rating: 3
The actual cookies were great, but I wasn't thrilled with the raw taste of the white icing. "Joy of Cooking" suggests that icing made with confectioner's sugar can be gently heated over a double boiler to get rid of that taste, so I'll try that next time. I used lemon juice but didn't notice any lemon taste (maybe this is because I used the bottled stuff); meant to use milk instead of water, but forgot and had no problem with transparent icing like other reviewers. Also, I used chocolate instead of cocoa in the icing -- tasted good, but didn't spread quite as smoothly. Next time I'll use regular cocoa. My cookies were done in only 11 minutes (maybe I should check my oven).

Rating: 2
I am also having trouble with the frosting. I agree about omitting the lemon. Even though lemons are usually lovely, the flavor just doesn't go here. Despite adding the milk, my icing was still translucent--almost transparent. I would like to make these again with a different icing recipe, perhaps one a bit denser, at least dense enough to frost without dripping everywhere.

Rating: 3
Help! I am from the South and heard of black-and-white's for the first time on an episode of Seinfeld. The cookies came out fine, but I am having a terrible time with the icing! Should it be thick, thin, what? And how in the world do you ice them without getting the two mixed up? Mine look more like marble cookies than black-and-white!

Rating: 3
Delicious rendition of black and white cookies. I'm a New Yorker so I've tasted these cookies before. I recommend decreasng the salt to 1/4 teaspoon, omitting the lemon from the icing, adding milk to the icing instead of water, and flattening out the cookies before you cook them. With all these changes, I would give the cookies 4 stars.

Rating: 3
I've made this recipe several times, but each time there is something funny tasting with the white icing. I'm hoping the milk will make it taste better, or maybe it's just the confectioners sugar I used. Has anyone else encountered that problem? Other than that, the cookies are fantastic!!!

Tasty and pretty close to authentic NY Black and White Cookies. Though the chocolate icing came out fine, I was a bit disappointed in the raw sugary flavor of the white icing. Also wish the recipe made more than 8 cookies. Has anyone tried doubling the recipe?

I thought these were great! I did add zest to the batter (very nice aroma when baking) and took reviewer advice to leave lemon out of chocolate icing but will not do this again as I think the lemon cuts the sweetness nicely. Concerned about the possible raw/harsh cocoa flavor I cooked the chocolate icing VERY CAREFULLY just a little, can't burn it! I can imagine different icing would be nice but then this icing seems typical of this cookie and I thought it tasted good and was very easy to work with. My guys at work loved them! How nice to have a recipe for this NYC cookie.

Unbelievable! I've lived in NY my whole life and Brooklyn for the last 8 and I have never ever ever found a B/W this tasty! My husband I made them and intended to eat two and bring the rest to the office...needless to say, they never made it to the office. You must try these!

Loved this recipie. Easy to make and fun to eat. I only changed one thing. When I made the cookies, I dropped them by a med size cookie scoop, this made a smaller cookie, but they were still soft and delicious. The icing was good, but some thought it had too much lemon in it, I will lessen the amt next time I make them.

Rating: 4
You must first go to NYC to have "the real thing," then make these at home, in order to truly capture the essence of this NYC standard. Don't buy them at a grocery store, or for goodness sake, the airport gift shop, it's just not the same. An NYC bakery only. Then do it at home. It won't be the same, but close. And shame on the cook who said they'd just make the cookies and skip the icing - they wouldn't be Black & Whites then, silly!

Rating: 3
These were absolutely delicious, but my cookies turned out very puffy, like a scone. Perhaps I was a little too generous in portioning out my dough. But the next time I will spread the dough out a little prior to baking. I also took some of the other reviewers' advice and left the lemon out of the cocoa icing. The flavor of the icing definitely changes/improves once it has hardened on the cookies. I am a diehard chocolate fan but I found that the lemony icing is a very nice contrast to the chocolate side.

Rating: 3
I made the recipe exactly as stated, and the cookies turned out very well--nicely shaped, too. To the other Denver reviewer, perhaps you baked the cookies too long. I discovered that mine were done in approx 12 minutes. I made no other adjustments for altitude. I thought the frosting was very easy to work with, although next time I will make more as I like a little more "sweet stuff" on my cookies. Also, I used a soup spoon to measure the dough and got 10 cookies, which I thought were a perfect size. I'll definatley try this recipe again.

The family loved these cookies (my husband cut them in half and ate only the chocolate side!). I did have to play with the consistency of the icing but will definitely make again.

Someone please help. I am from NY and love Half Moons/Black and Whites. The altitude here in Denver must have affected the outcome. They were like rocks. Does anyone know how to ammend the recipe for high-altitudes?

I used only half of the cocoa powder, mixed the dough with a fork (since I don't have a mixer) and ended up with some very tasty dark-brown-and-white cookies. If I were to make this again, I would separate the icing earlier and add the lemon juice only to the white half for a more assertively lemony taste; on the dark half, the lemon flavor was pretty much wasted/drowned out by the chocolate. I don't like too much sweetness in my desserts, so if I ever get a chance to make this recipe just for myself, I'll try adding the lemon juice directly to the dough and skipping the icing altogether for a fluffy, lemony cookie without the hassle of spreading the icing.

My husband loves these cookies! He says they're the best he's had.

As a former Bostonian, now living in CT, I grew up calling these "half-moons". Since CT is so close to NY, they are also called Black and Whites. I doubled the recipe, and baked the cookie in a pizza pan making this into a giant black and white birthday cookie. It was fantastic. Had a little trouble with the frosting but with more sugar and less liquid it came out fine. I have already made three of them and have requests for more.

I followed the recipe exactly, except doubled, and they were wonderful! Will make them again soon, not only as black and whites but also with different frosting flavors like mocha and white, black and raspberry, orange and white, etc--just by adding other flavors to the white frosting.

Doubled the recipe and used ice cream scoop that was probably more like 1/8 of a cup for smaller cookies- they had a nice texture and good flavor. I didn't add nearly as much cocoa powder as called for, just eyeballed it and added more water to both white and chocolate- I wanted the consistency of spreadable icing, not a glaze, and used a small offset spatula. I found it easiest to do the chocolate side first then go back with the white, but I thought the other reviewer's idea of icing all with white and then making the rest of your icing choc. is terrific. I have only had a B and W in NYC a few times, and I didn't realize that they have a distinct lemony flavor, as one reviewer mentioned. It may be heresy, but the next time I make these, I'm leaving out the lemon juice entirely- I didn't like the lemony flavor in contrast with the chocolate.

Rating: 4
I brought this to my inlaws home as well as my grandparents. They all FINALLY agreed on something, that these cookies were wonderful. I thought I put a little too much lemon juice on the white part but my toughest critics loved them. I melted Chocolate over a double boiler for the Chocolate part instead of doing it the way the recipe called for. IT was Wonderful

Rating: 3
The first time they came out to high in the middle so I increased the buttermilk to 1/2 cup-it worked. I also flatten them before baking-a must. I frost all the white sides first instead of separating the icing in half then I add the chocolate to what is left. They went like hot cakes at work. They bring back great memories of Brooklyn, NY and yes, we called them "black and whites".

Either I did something wrong (quite possible) or I've missed the boat. I didn't find these great.

I'll try again, but with another recepie.

Great cookies but the frosting is kind of tricky. I doubled the cookie dough. I may be a little generous on the frosting, but I had to triple the recipe for the frosting and even that wasn't enough. The frosting is the best part. I used regular cookie pans with nonstick spray which worked okay. For optimum results, it's worth it to go with parchment paper. All in all, a good recipe for B&W cookies.

I have been searching for the perfect Black and White recipe forever and this recipe is the best so far. I used a small ice scoop and made miniature ones. Sometimes the big ones are too much for people. Had some trouble with the icing and needed to add extra water as well. I baked them on stoneware, but believe that they really need to be baked on non-stick cookie sheets. Delicious!! Thanks for the recipe!!!

If you don't flatten out the batter prior to cooking, these cookies puff up too much and resemble half-spheres. To get a close facsimile to the NYC icon, try to make them as wide and flat as possible.

Rating: 4
Amazing! This recipe was right-on--just like the ubiquitous NY bakery treats of my childhood! Notes: 1) I only made 6, not 8, to get them the exact correct size, and then they puffed up perfectly--didn't spread much, but did curve nicely in the middle; 2) as others have said, I added vanilla and lemon zest to the cookies themselves for the slight lemon flavor these cookies always have; 3) again, as others have said, I used less lemon juice in the icing and a tad more water and vanilla. I also had to play around with the proportions of the frosting a little bit, but this recipe as a whole was very, very close to the perfect black and white. BTW, no one in NY calls them "black and white _cookies." They're just plain old "black and whites."

I made these for a bake sale, and they got a lot of oohs and ahhs (we're in Wisconsin, so people aren't very familiar with NYC-type products). I had trouble with the frosting and ended up making 2 batches, with better results the 2nd time. I found 1/4 C of cocoa to be way, way too much, and put in just 1 heaping T the second time. The amount of frosting made doesn't leave much wiggle room, so you can afford to be generous with measuring. I also brushed off all loose crumbs before frosting, and that helped them look neater. I did find the flavor a little bland, but I think kids may prefer them that way.

I live in Upstate, NY. In my town, these cookies were different than the NYC style cookie, which sounds delicious. We called ours "Half Moons." The cookies were large and cake-like, as in this recipe, but they were always chocolate. The frosting was half white and half chocolate, but was thick, like a cake frosting, not a glaze...no lemon to the white frosting, just vanilla flavor. Does anyone have a recipe for this variation?

Really a 2 1/2 fork but rounded up because my childhood memories of these cookies enhanced the experience! The cake like consistancy of the cookie was perfect even if the taste wasn't. Will add almond extact and/or lemon juice and maybe more vanilla next time. I reduced the lemon juice and cocoa in half for the icing and it worked ok. Interestingly, these cookies taste 100% better the next day. I'll definately make again because the ease of this recipe and the fact that it yields just 8 nice sized cookies makes it a pefect weekday family treat.

As a former New Yorker, these were and still are my favorite cookie. I was disappointed with the recipe as I didn't think the icing was very good.

Fresh Meadows - I didn't butter the sheet - I used parchment instead - cookies were uniformly perfect - I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and added a tiny bit of fresh lemon zest. As a native New Yorker the only B&Ws I ate as a child always had a lemon undertone

Another suggestions for the woman whose dough ran all over the stove. This happened to my mother once when she had made a pound cake. We realized she'd used self-rising flour instead of plain. We called the exploding cake her Mt. St. Helen's cake!

Just a reply to one of the comments: my mother had the melting batter in the oven problem once. In her case, it was that she realized that she had not added all of the flour (she added two 1/2 cups (i.e., 1 cup) instead of two AND 1/2 cups of flour--it was Christmas craziness and she was tired!). So maybe something along those lines happened???

These are one of my favorites, and it's great to be able to make them at home. If you shape the dough slightly into a ball (spray your hands with cooking spray) you get a more uniform cookie. Freshmeadows - It sounds like your oven isn't hot enough. Sounds like it may need to be recalibrated.

The black and whites of my youth in NY had thicker icing on top; following this recipe results in an icing that is something closer to a glaze, and the chocolate side tasted heavily of cocoa powder to me. But it was fun to find a recipe for the cake-y cookie! I will do these again after I find a good alternative to the icing.
