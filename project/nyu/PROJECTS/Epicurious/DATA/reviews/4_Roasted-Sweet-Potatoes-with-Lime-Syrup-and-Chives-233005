Excellent. What a surprise with that first bite! I plan to add this recipe to my Thanksgiving menu, but I will not wait that long to make again.

I would have given this 4 forks but I made a few changes based on other reviewer comments. Used olive oil instead of butter, added a generous helping of cayenne, doubled the sauce and halved the sugar. Did not get crispy, but this was delicious. Yummy mixed with the salad on the plate.

Simple. Easy. Colorful. Healthy. Delicious. The lime was such a bright addition to the sweetenss of the potatoes. Excellent with the char-roasted chickens from our local Peruvian chicken place!

Made it in advance to bring to Thanksgiving dinner and it reheated beautifully. Don't forget the lime syrup, chives and zest (easy to do in the chaos of a pre-dinner kitchen!). A truly different and delicious side.

Fantastic! Used half the chives, and added some leftover chopped cilantro. I will certainly make it again.

This is our new favorite. I made it exactly to the recipe and it is fabulous. Never eating mashed, marshmallow version again.

The best sweet potatoes ever! The tart of the lime is the perfect compliment for the mellow richness of the potatoe. I add a bit more lime, and and the zest is essential.YUM!

Loved this. Fixed it for Christmas dinner and it's a keeper. Roasted vegetables are delicious because their flavor gets more intense. The lime dressing is a nice touch. Oh, and did I say easy?

Great recipe, definitely a keeper. I'm always looking for good recipes to break the monotony of winter cooking when the CSA keeps giving us root vegetables. Made this for a potluck and it was a bit hit. Wonderful thai-like flavor using scallions. Left the sweet potato a bit firmer than I usually eat it when baking which was great. Lime zest was key. Scallions were great, can't wait to try this with chives.

I liked the contrast of the sour versus the sweet in this dish. I followed the suggestion of adding scallions instead of chives (because that's what I had in the fridge) and I also added chopped fresh cilantro. I paired it with roasted pork tenderloin with a tomato and paprika cream sauce and it was an excellent combination. Will definitely make it again.

This is a fantastic recipe and always impresses the guests. I make it a bit healthier by tossing the potatoes with 2 tbls of olive oil instead of butter and finishing the lime syrup up with 2 tablespoons of butter for richness. I often use scallions instead of chives for more punch.

Added an extra tablespoon of fresh lime juice. This recipe was really great, it has full flavor and paired really well with Ribeye Steak.

Very nice dish. I used half canola oil to cut down on butter. Also used brown sugar because it always goes well with sweet potatoes. comfort food?

I loved this! I had some sweet potatoes that needed to get used up and I wanted to find a new way to cook them. I added a little more salt and agave syrup at the end because I thought the flavor needed a little boost, but other than that it was fantastic. The sweet/salty/savory flavor was great.

Made this last night to go with halibut and thought it was really tasty. My husband, who professes not to like sweet potatoes, also liked it. Following others, I baked the potatoes, let them rest, then added the syrup (with cayenne), tossed and reheated. Actually, they were plenty cooked so I just threw them under the broiler for a couple minutes.

This is awesome! My family loved it as did I, it will be on the table every holiday dinner.

I thought that this tasted just OK. I doubled the sauce, as many suggested, but it still didn't seem to add much flavor. The potatoes were not crunchy at all; in fact, they were mushy. Won't make it again.

We liked the fact that these sweet potatoes were chunky, which stood them in nice contrast to the many pureed and mashed dishes at our Thanksgiving dinner (e.g.: mashed potatoes; green bean casserole; corn pudding; oyster stuffing). However, we felt the amount of lime/sugar sauce was pretty inadequate for the volume of potatoes. As made, the lime flavor was barely detectable. We plan to try this dish again next year and will double or perhaps triple the amount of sauce.

Was pressed for time and oven space, so I could not rotate and maybe that's why they were a little soft. I did mine with honey and a little cane sugar, and extra lime juice, and caramelized the sauce in the pan. Let it cool then added extra zest and guajillo chile powder. Forgot the chives, but they were fabulous!

Loved this dish as a trial run for Thanksgiving. Made as is -- only thing sweet potatoes did not get crunchy. Will try less with butter and to roast longer. Great, unexpected flavors that will work well with a heavy turkey dinner.

Wow, I really liked this one a lot. I had apprehensions initially because I usually like my sweet potatoes the traditional way (cinnamon, butter, brown sugar...). I rarely make a recipe as directed and this being the case, I eliminated the butter altogether. Instead, I laid the potatoes out on a foil lined jellyroll pan sprayed lightly with butter flavored cooking spray. I then sprayed the potatoes with the cooking spray & sprinkled (did not measure) with salt & pepper, 3/4t. seems like a lot. Roasted per instructions. Per other reviewer's suggestion, I subbed honey for the sugar and added about 1/4 t. cumin, few dashes of cayenne & the same of chipotle powder to the glaze. Once the roasting was completed, I placed the potatoes in a bowl, poured the glaze atop, returned to pan and back in the oven for about 5-10 more minutes to allow the glaze to caramelize. Finished with chives (really had reservations about adding those), they really complimented the flavors. I would double the glaze in the future. This would be a great brunch menu, I served with brown sugar baked ham, poached eggs & the filling from the Blackberry Hand Pies recipe from this site. Will be making again!

This is a really wonderful way to prepare sweet potatoes. Add the chile pepper and a touch of cayenne as others have recommended. And swoon.

For something this simple, I thought it was fantastic. I made a point to lightly blend this to keep it from getting too mushy. I will definitely make it again.

I absolutely loved this! I used honey and cayenne like another reviewer did and it was great. I also added a pinch of chili powder and cumin. Soooooo good - especially cold.

Made this for dinner tonight - loved it. Instead of making a syrup, I used honey, and half of the butter called for. I drizzled the glaze over the potatoes after they roasted, then gently tossed them, and put them back in the oven for another 10 minutes or so. The glaze baked into the potatoes...yum. I did't use the chives, and added some cayenne pepper to the glaze. Delicious and great flavors.

Did it twice. First, only substitution was olive oil for butter (for health reasons). We loved it. Second time, added chili powder and substituted cilantro for chives. We still love it! Should help those who think sweet potatoes are things that grow on marshmallows...

Added roasted carrots and served to my vegetarian son with great success, a good combo of vegetables with a splash of lime.

I have made this recipe with both sweet potatoes and yams. I actually think I preferred it with the yams (particularly for the more orange color of them.) I used the juice and zest of one large lime. I didn't sprinkle them with chives-but might try cilantro as one reviewer suggested. Next time I will try doubling the sauce and using two large limes.

Easy and very tasty. Followed directions as written and turned out perfect.

Good recipe just the way it is. I paired this with a roasted salmon dish and it was wonderful. Next day, I mashed the leftovers with a little liquid, and they were still good! Will definitely make again, but will not cook the sweet potatoes so long.

We all loved this at Thanksgiving, and I'm going to use it for the Christmas crowd too! I did double the lime sauce - it was wonderful! Don't scrimp on the zest or fresh lime juice. We forgot chives, and it was still great.

I'm an avid lover of sweet potatoes, and this will now be one of my official Thanksgiving side dish! EAsy to prepare and absolutely delicious!

I was very disappointed. Tasted like plain roasted sweet potato's. I did make double the lime syrup and the taste was still bland. I would say I'd never make this again, however, after everyone else's rave reviews, I'm going to try it again. I used the juice that I squeezed from a fresh lime. Should I have used the lime juice from one of the plastic bottles? Recipe doesn't specify, so I'll try again w/ the juice already made.

The quick cooking prevents the sweet potatoes from getting stringy as they sometimes do when baking. I had syrup left over because I used up the sweet potatoes in the ham and sweet potato hash recipe from elsewhere on epicurious.

Tastiest sweetpotatoes I've ever had! Will definitely make again. I had fewer sweet potatoes and made the full recipe of sauce, so I'd agree, double the sauce amount. I also used almost no butter... just lightly oiled. Worked fine... I'm sure it's tastier with the butter but for those of us watching our weights/colesterol you really lose very little and can taste the potatoes better.

I was served this at our cooking club. It is one of the best sweet potato dishes I have ever had. Quite delicious and it looks relatively simple.

Yummy! I would double the sauce. Very light and refreshing-limes give a surprise taste.

I stumbled on to this recipe by taking this same lime/butter combo for the fish dish I was preparing and poured the balance on the sweet potatoes baked then sliced...I couldn't believe the combination of lime and sweet potato. Can't wait for Thanksgiving at Mom's.

Yes, these are good. Expect an exotic taste (maybe Caribian?). I have tried these with cilantro instead of the chives, too, with great results. It's nice with grilled or baked chicken (the sauce compliments!)
