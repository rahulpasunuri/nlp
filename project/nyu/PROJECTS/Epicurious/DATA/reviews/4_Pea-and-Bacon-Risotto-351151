This is a great and simple recipe. But NOTE THAT THE RECIPE IS FOR ONE SERVING ONLY!

A nice risotto with just a few ingredients. Use your best bacon and freshest peas; the lemon zest and juice is an absolute must. A lovely dinner paired with a salad and a dry rose or your favorite white.

Some of you suggest using white wine. Would this replace the lemon juice, how much should you use, and at what point in the process would u add it?

Rating: 2
Definitely quick and easy. Couldn't taste the garlic at all, but love the idea of using lemon instead of wine. Still, the flavor was not there.....Maybe adding mint would help.....

really good. i added a couple things to the recipe, like caramelized onions, but overall the recipe itself was delicious.. everyone involved in the eating process was well pleased.

Wow. Perhaps one of the best risotto recipes I've made. Note -- the recipe is for ONE serving.

Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! I used double the amount of bacon and baby sweet peas, frozen. Don't skimp on the lemon zest - it makes all the difference.

I would definitely make this again! As a single gal it's nice to have recipes for one rather than try to reduce one (easier to double or triple rather than halve, IMO). I would use reduced-sodium chicken broth, as it's a bit salty. I used turkey bacon, still just as lovely, but you might need to add a bit of oil since it's not as greasy. And of course, add wine! (Everything's better with wine :)

This was delicious! Also, inexpensive and easy. Hardly any prep work, so a great dish to make when you want something warm and comforting after a hard day at the office. I doubled the bacon and garlic, and--having fresh thyme I needed to get rid off--added 2 teaspoons of thyme with the peas. Oh so good. Will make this again and again.

This recipe is easy, simple yet flavorful. You'll see me making this risotto many times in the future. Thanks epicurious!

Loved by all! Very yummy. The bacon on top at the end was preferred by me... the one person who thought it was a bad idea in the first place. The lemon was awesome. Use good cheese.

Great recipe, very tasty both hot for dinner and cold for lunch the next day. I tripled the recipe, since this only made one serving. What's that about, epicurious? The main dish serves one and the salad serves six? However, I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent. I used some truffle butter at the end, which gave this an elegant twist. Just the right consistency. It did take substantially longer than 20 minutes to cook the rice, but that doesn't bother me.

This was so satisfying -- to make and to eat. My guests loved it. I ended up using every bit of the broth. Note: this recipe is for one. Double, triple, quadruple as necessary.

I had wine so added it before starting to add the stock. I ran out of it and had to add a cup of water in the end. It took way more than 20' to cook. I substituted cheddar for the parmigiana and didn't bother with the zest. YUM! I inhaled it.

Rating: 4
Absolutely Delicious. The portion described is very small for a complete main dish- I suggest x3 for 2 people. We used 1/2 chicken broth 1/2 good white wine. (I will leave out the lemon next time)

Rating: 4
This is a standard meal in our house because we always have the ingredients on hand and it's always delicious! It's our go-to recipe whenever we don't know what to make for dinner! We love lots of lemon and garlic, so we tend to add a bit more than suggested. We also use a small onion or shallot as well to give it a bit more depth. Yum, yum, yum.

Yummy! I was verrrry generous with the cheese and the garlic (we love both) and instead of water I used wine and chicken broth. Excellent with fish!

This was my first Risotto and this recipe was good. Too much lemon as it was too dominant. IMO it should be more subtle.

Rating: 4
Very, very good. Was a huge hit with 4 foodie friends. Read the reviews as there are some good tips. I used lardons, instead of bacon & then sauteed onion & shallot mix and kept it in pot. It wasn't greasy. Added rice & 3/4C white wine, let it soak a bit and followed recipe. I will reduce lemon next time - a little too lemony for me. Used stock to reduce flavor. It was a very appealing dish to look at.

Rating: 4
An excellent recipe. I tripled the recipe which was a great amount for a 4-person side dish. The bacon adds some richness that isn't overpowering. The only change might be some white wine added to the broth, and omit the lemon or lessen the amount a little.

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I doubled the recipe to serve two. The only change I made was to use twice as much parmesan (or 4 times, if you're doubling the recipe).

WOW. Our risotto turned out creamy and absolutely delicious. We ate it as a side to some marinated pork tenderloin, and the two worked very well together. This recipe is certainly not overrated. The only change we made to it was to add a little bit of white wine to the broth mixture to give it some more flavor. Yum!

Note: this recipe makes *exactly* 1 serving of risotto, definitely double it if you are serving more than 1. However, that one serving is extremely delicious. I've already made it twice since I found the recipe last week. I add some chopped mushrooms and cooked shrimp, and skip the cheese. The first time I used low heat and it took forever for the rice to cook, so using medium heat for both the broth and the rice went a lot better. It all comes together at the end once you add the butter and take it off the heat. Really tasty and pretty quick. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful. Worth the stirring time. Made as written with a couple of exceptions: didn't use bacon so started with a saute of 1 Tbs butter and 1 shallot. Then followed the recipe using fresh peas since they were in season. Marvelous.

Yummy! Quick and easy to make. Don't skimp on the lemon juice or zest it adds a nice fresh flavor.

This is VERY good. I did it with fresh peas though and left out the bacon (we had it as a side to a roast pork tenderloin. Be liberal with the cheese. I also started mine off with some white wine, because why not? Also, the lemon was a great touch. It would be lovely as a side to fish...... bitterendive.blogspot.com

My second risotto and it was delicious! I added one more garlic clove since I LOVE garlic! Did everything else as it said to. Was perfect!

Made it once as written and it was very nice. Made it again & totally blew it. Here's what NOT to do: double the recipe and use short grain brown rice and a bullion cube for 1 cup of the broth. It became a super salty 2.5 hour affair that was barely salvaged with sugar and extra lemon juice.

All 4 of us loved it - even the 3 year old! Was a tad salty, but still yummy. We plan to use this regularly. We will triple the recipe next time. It was enough for one meal, but no left-overs.

Perfect as is; easy and exceptionally good for company. I even cooked it ahead of time and had to keep it warm in the oven (usually a huge no-no) and it was still fab.

A keeper! I tripled the recipe, used a small-med chopped onion and duck bacon instead. Great for a weeknight meal. The lemon is subtle but a great addition.

This was my very first risotto and I'm so pleased with how it turned out. It's homey and comforting and easy and inexpensive. I burned the garlic a little, so watch out for that. Remember to sprinkle the bacon on last last last so it stays crispy. I'll definitely make it again and other risottos now that I have some experience under my belt.

This was great, but a little salty. I'm sure it was the broth I used (I like that Better Than Bouillon concentrate stuff), but I just wanted to add a word of warning to other cooks to watch the saltiness. Otherwise great, though, I'll be making this again. Husband loved it.

Skipped on the peas as hubby and kids don't like them. I forgot to get the low sodium broth so it was a little too salty but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I trippled the recipe and it turned out quite yummy.

Made this for my GF last night and served with Filet Mignon and a salad. Great dish!!! My GF who doesn't like peas even said it was good. I probably will go without the lemon zest next time

What a great recipe. Easy and delicious. I've found referring to it as "PEAS and bacon risotto" helps when recommending the recipe.

This was just divine! I added a little more bacon, more lemon zest/juice, and it was a hit. The original recipe is good, but only makes the smallest single serve. I would suggest not just doubling the ingredients, but 4-6 times and save some for ron!

I followed this recipe pretty much to the T, although I had to use bouillon to make the broth, since that's all i had. Either way, great flavor! Very bacony, which is a good thing in our house.

Great dish- it's so easy you can't screw it up. Use definitely more than one slice of bacon.

I made this last night for a few friends and we all loved it! Having read the reviews on here beforehand, I added one strip of bacon, more garlic and red onion and it really kicked up the flavors. I also used a bit of vermouth, since I tend to cook most everything with at least a splash of wine. It added a nice depth to it. I had forgotten to buy lemons when shopping for this, but living in CA, I am blessed with a lemon tree in my backyard and I'm really glad I had a few ripe ones... that squeeze of lemon really brightens this recipe - don't skip it!

This risotto was simple yet delicious and perfect for a weeknight meal. I doubled the recipe and made almost exactly as written. However, I drained out most of the bacon fat before adding the garlic and I used a blend of romano, parmigiano and aged provolone, since I had small pieces of each in the fridge. I love risotto, and the lemon in this version added a surprising brightness to the dish. I will definitely make this again.

I was disappointed with this recipe. It was fine but the elements didn't blend as well as I had hoped.

I can't get enough of this risotto! It is quite simple to make and I didn't have to alter the ingredients at all. I did add a little extra lemon to my portion because I just really can't get enough lemon. Risotto is not the fastest dish ever, but I just like to pull a stool up to the stove, pour a glass of wine, and stir away. I love that the ingredients are so simple and common, because I often reach for this recipe when I just can't think of anything to make. It's always satisfying!

Rating: 4
Easy and yummy. My two favorite things! I just tried it this evening. I made 2 versions. One with no variations. For the second, I sauteed scallops in a little olive oil, lemon juice, and garlic pepper, then stirred them in just before serving. I'd make either one again!

Simple, but absolutely delicious risotto recipe. I doubled the recipe to serve two, and the only change I made was substituting a finely chopped shallot for the garlic - I thought that shallots would pair better with the bacon & peas and lend a more subtle flavor to the risotto.

Rating: 4
Very good. My three-year-old asked for seconds, which is rare. Next time, I think I will probably cook the bacon in the microwave as I begin the risotto to save time, using olive oil or butter to saute the garlic instead of bacon fat.

Rating: 4
What a wonderful recipe! It uses ingredients that most of us have in our pantry and still comes out beautifully. I actually made this recipe very close to the way it was written. I did limit the quantity of butter a bit (maybe 2/3 of what it called for), but otherwise I kept it pretty much by the book. And we loved it! Don't limit the lemon. It cuts the richness of the dish and pairs well with the peas. Definitely follow the instruction to use low sodium broth, since the bacon and the cheese are so salty. I chose to use pancetta as my bacon and loved the lightness of that flavor.

Rating: 4
I just made this and it's one of the most incredible risottos I've ever eaten. Simple but it hits just the right note. I could probably eat this every day. I used maple bacon which added a great sweet hint, and a lot more peas because I love peas, and added wine as recommended by other reviewers. I'd recommend going easy on the lemon and cheese, and next time I might try using a higher chicken broth to water ratio.

Rating: 4
I was tipsy when I ate this, so maybe I was overly enthusiastic, but I thought this was absolutely delicious. Incidentally, I was also tipsy when I made it - it was that easy! Definitely one to make again (and again). Oh, and I doubled the recipe as there were two of us - I was not drinking alone.

I could eat risotto every day, so I was excited to try this version. I doubled it to serve 2, and that worked perfectly as a main course. I liked the brightness of the lemon, but I think I'd use a little less, as it seemed a little too lemony. I have no objection to using white wine instead (if I remember right, part of the draw for this is to use a squirt of lemon at the end instead of messing around with white wine). But, since I'll make risotto on any given weeknight, that sort of thing doesn't bother me. I'd definitely make this again. Very tasty.

Holy mother...this was the best recipe EVER! We had everything we needed in our pantry and fridge and were dying for something creamy and comforting. THIS was it. We ate every last shred of risotto and cried for more. Don't change a thing!

I like this recipe, even if here in Italy the basic flavour for RISOTTO is always ONION - not garlic. I will test it soon !!!

This was simple and very good for the minimal effort. Perhaps it's a little bland but I think it's perfect for younger palates. I have a 5 year old who will eat anything and a picky 14 month old and both loved this risotto. The toddler even ate the peas and she hates peas.

There were a few reviewers that said the risotto was bland. I took that as a warning and added a few extra ingredients. I also took and made the recipe for 2 instead of one and it came out perfect. After you add the rice to the pan put in a ¼ cup of dry white wine and let it soak in, then start adding the broth. I also added half of a small onion to the mix, finely chopped and 2 extra cloves of garlic. During the cooking process I added a couple pinches of sea salt to give it a little extra flavor. I would still recommend added the lemon zest at the end it adds a good touch to the risotto. All in all it was a good dish. I also did not add that much water to my broth. I left the bacon grease and in the pan which wasnt much if you can find lean bacon it works the best.

This recipe is written for one serving which I found strange. So for six servings or better you should make at least 2 cups of the Aborio Rice. I made three cups, used 6 slices of bacon, used an entire stick of salted butter, and about a cup or better of parmesan cheese. Also added some frozen corn too. As for the bland taste, bump it up by using FAR more garlic than this recipe calls for. I used garlic powder instead of real garlic and did it to taste. TOTALLY omitted any lemon because my kids wouldn't

I never made risotto before and this was a perfect way to start. It was very simple, and it came out really well. I added grilled chicken breast to the mix and one extra slice of bacon.

Recipe turned out well and the lemon juice definitely 'brightened up' the flavors, but overall I felt this was pretty bland. I would not serve it to my gourmet friends, but would make it again for the family or persons with less adventurous and less discriminating palates.
