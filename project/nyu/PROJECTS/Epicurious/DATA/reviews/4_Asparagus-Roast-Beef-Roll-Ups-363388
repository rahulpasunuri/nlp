Four forks for this pretty and delicious hors d'oeuvre or appetizer that took only a few minutes to throw together. I microwaved my asparagus to perfect crisp-tender state (2mins. 45 secs. in my microwave), used what I had in the 'fridge to make the sauce (cream cheese + yoghurt), ended up using 3 tsp horseradish (probably old). Also added a dash of curry, just because. Requested 14 slices of roast beef from the deli counter instead of ordering by weight -- figured that was a better way to match the number of asparagus I was using.
