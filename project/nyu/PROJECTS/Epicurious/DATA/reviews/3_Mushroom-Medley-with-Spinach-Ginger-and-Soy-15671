Truly delicious. I always add WAY more ginger & garlic, but we like that flavor. Used 10 oz shiitake & 16 oz baby bella & 12 oz baby spinach. Next time will add MUCH more spinach Totally forgot to pass the lemon wedges, so not sure how that will enhance recipe, but will try.

Cooked with fish; very good.

We are a family of mushroom lovers, and so this was destined to be a fave. The flavors blend beautifully, but still maintain clarity between bites of different mushroom varieties. I've even tried this subbing in varieties other than those listed, with great results. Served with a fish dish and simple buttered rice sopping up juices, this is a big hit in my house every time!

My husband & I both liked this dish. Next time I will put the peppers in after the mushrooms cook a bit as I like my peppers a bit more crisp. Otherwise, made as recipe states.

Yummy! Sadly, I had to leave out the spinach (my dad and brother won't touch it), but next time I'll definitely include it. Also, I ended up using green pepper instead of red, which wasn't as colorful but did the job. This went beautifully with this site's "Seared Salmon with Orange Glaze" and wild rice.

left out red pepper, green onion, and lemon as I didn't have them. A bit bland but went well with the honey ginger salmon someone suggested (also this site). I would make it again using the red pepper and onion and maybe adding dried red pepper flakes.

Both my husband and I really liked with recipe. I didn't use the lemon and reduced the amount of ginger by half after reading some of the other reviews. It went perfectly with salmon. I'm on Weight Watcher's and my husband is on the Atken's diet, so it's difficult to find tasty things that fit both plans. This worked wonderfully.

Just so-so, and definitely better without the lemon. Makes for a pretty dish, though..

Wonderful side dish. I used only baby portobello mushrooms (pre-sliced, made prep very fast) and it was still delicious.

I added some asparagus tips - very good.

Next time I make this, I'll lessen the amount of ginger. I didn't use any lemon. Goes well with fish.

Very good side dish which I ate with steamed fish. It has a nice woodsy-earthy taste. The lemon at the end I thought was a little overpowering and didn't blend well with the other flavors. The dish tasted even better the next day.

This tasted like a restaurant quality side dish. I brought in Chinese Food for company, and made this as a side dish. Everyone loved it! It was pretty and tasted delicious!

I served this with "Chinese Sea Bass" and my husband said it was one of the best meals I've ever made! I only had button mushrooms on hand, and I did skip the lemon, but I thought the bell pepper added great flavor and color. I also sprinkled crushed red pepper into the saute.

This is a lovely side dish with an Asian-inspired meal. I'd skip the bell pepper and lemon. It also makes a nice light meal if you add baby shrimp or cubed tofu and serve with rice.

A nice, tasty side dish, particularly good with fish. Next time I'll use bok choy instead of spinach, cut down on the sesame oil, and substitute half a tablespoon of kejap manis (sweet Indonesian soy sauce) for half of the soy in the recipe. Also, give the lemon a miss.

I found the flavors incompatible. The dish tasted better the following day eaten cold.

Delicious and easy. Goes well with Honey-Ginger Salmon (another excellent recipe).
