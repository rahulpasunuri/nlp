Pretty tasty for a low fat chocolate thing. Followed others' suggestions and increased apple sauce to 1 cup (used homemade plum sauce, but it works the same really.) Also, used just 3 beaten eggs instead of fussing with egg whites. Baked for 32 min and it is super moist and tender. Next time will use 1/3C of melted butter instead of veg oil in hopes of a richer taste.

I decided to give this recipe another try, with a few changes. I addedanother 1/2 cup of applesauce, cut back a bit on the oil (I used coconut oil rather than vegetable oil - it adds a bit of a coconutty flavor, which is nice), and used 2 tsp baking powder. I also only baked it for 25 minutes. It turned out FANTASTIC. I took it to a party, and had 3 people ask me for the recipe. I will definitely be making these brownies again.

This cake tasted pretty good, but was VERY dry. I baked it for only 30 minutes, and it was already dry. If I'd left it in for another 5 minutes, it would have been inedible. I did what others had suggested, and used 1 cup of the applesauce, and 2 tsp baking powder. I also used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and substituted Stevia for sugar. It's a pretty good cake for being low fat and low sugar. Next time, I'm going to add another 1/2 cup applesauce, and I'll only bake it for 20-25 minutes. I'll let you know how it turns out.

I made this for the second time and incorporated the comments about doubling the baking powder and I used 1c. of applesauce instead of the 2/3c. I also added 1/4c. of espresso powder to enhance the chocolate flavor. It was fantastic and a big hit with my parents. I think this time around, it stayed nice and moist and the espresso was just that extra bit of something to boost the chocolate flavor. It can't ever by too chocolate for me! I'm going to make it just like this from now on, again, it was fantastic!

I thought this was really good. It doesn't have brownie-like texture, it's definitely a cake. I used 82% chocolate instead of unsweetened. I have a weight watchers recipe for brownies that's almost exactly the same (no oil) but has 2 cups sugar. I couldn't bring myself to make something with twice as much sugar as flour, so I was happy to find this recipe.

Good but could have been better if I had used sweeter chocolate. I did double the baking powder as suggested and the consistency was perfect for us.

I added another 1/3 cup of applesauce and it was moist and delicious. I also used semi-sweet chocolate so that it wasn't so bitter. Also, using the remaing chocolate (if you use a chocolate baking bar) I melted it and drizzled over top with powdered sugar. I received many compliments.

This was very good. I served it with fresh cut strawberries and lowfat vanilla icecream ...I then drizzled each slice with chocolate sauce. As for the recipe, I doubled the baking powder and rather than using 1 cup of traditional flour, I used 1/2 cup traditional and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour...you couldn't even tell.

P.S. I forgot to say that I took the advice of "A Cook from New York City" and doubled the baking powder. I'm sure that helped.

I had some leftover slightly sweetened cranberry sauce I'd made and substituted that for the applesauce. I also used 3 whole eggs rather than having to bother with separating them. The cake was fantastic! The cranberries made the cake taste like a rich chocolate cherry cake. The whole family loved it.

This was excellent, surprisingly. The chocolate flavor was deep, texture was dense and yummy. No hint of applesauce and loved the low-fat aspect.

I really, really didn't like it. The recipe was accurate, and nothing went wrong, but it just tasted kind of like dirt. I don't know how it could be made better. It tasted a bit like something my dog would bake me as a gift. But if you like to try healthy variations of desserts, you could give it a try.

This recipe definitely doesn't taste lowfat. I followed it almost exactly, except that I bought sweetened applesauce by mistake and so I reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. I didn't notice it being dry, but I monitored the cooking time very carefully and took it out of the oven at 30 minutes. My only complaint is that it's a little too dense. Next time, I will beat the eggs for a longer period of time, reduce the oil and maybe add some baking soda, so it has a little more air in it.

If you still want that buttery taste but not the fat, and are suspicious about using applesauce as a substitute, try using SmartSqueeze liquid butter, which is fat free. Works great in this recipe!!

This was an excellent lower fat chocolate cake. I've made other things with applesauce instead of butter and they are usually not that good, but it seems to work well for this cake. A tip for when you don't have any solid bittersweet chocolate (which I never seem to have)... substitute 1 tbs oil and 3 tbs unsweetened cocoa power for every ounce of bittersweet chocolate.

Pretty good. We actually thought it tasted very close to an extremely decadent chocolate cake I'd made several weeks earlier. I was very pleased with this as a low-fat recipe. However, it was a bit dry and chalky tasting the second day. Next time I'll make it with semi-sweet chocolate and less cocoa as my husband said the chocolate taste was too strong and bitter.

Very good! I listened to the reviews and increased the amount of oil and made it in a bundt pan. I added chocolate chips but it would have been good without. I served it with fat-free, sugar-free vanilla pudding. Everyone had seconds!

I agree with the previous reviewer, I will definitely make this again but I was a little underwhelmed by my first attempt. I added more applesauce and made it in a bundt pan -- it looked very pretty dusted with confectioner's sugar. While it was nice and moist (and my kids gobbled it up, albeit with ice cream), it was not as "chocolatey" as I would have liked. It seemed like something was missing. I'll try adding coffee syrup (suggested by a previous reviewer) or perhaps mashed ripe bananas instead of applesauce.

I only gave this one fork, but said I would make it again because I am intrigued by the challenge of actually making this cake good. Sure, I was having an "out-of-it" day when I was making this (couldn't find the bottom of my springform pan so I used glass, absentmindedly cracked an egg white into the dry ingredient bowl, etc.), so maybe THAT is why it tasted horrid. The consistency was terrible and the taste was very bland and bitter. If you make this, follow the directions exactly because maybe that is where I went wrong. But I still expected the taste to be a lot better.

This was very good. Found it better the next day. Took one reviewer's suggestion and served it with the low fat vanilla custard from this site. Worth making.

Rating: 4
I'm rating this four forks on the basis that it is excellent for a low-fat recipe. I did add a little extra applesauce as some of the cooks suggested and two extra tablespoons of oil, so it wasn't too dry. I instead used a half cup of sugar and added 10 Equal packets and it was definitely sweet enough. My super-picky husband even thought it was great.

After reading warnings about possible dryness, & since I wanted a bigger cake, I increased the recipe by 1/2 (luckily easy fractions!) and baked it in a 9 1/2" springform, but KEPT the 35 min. baking time. Moist results. Raspberry sauce & lowfat Breyer's vanilla ice cream.

I normally don't like cake, but this recipe is great, especially with a little extra applesauce added to the batter and a tiny bit of chocolate glaze drizzled on top.

As a compulsive dieter,I've tried many lousy low-fat dishes, but this rocked! I've read some other reviews, and adding full-fat ingredients like peanut butter, etc. defeats the purpose of a low-fat recipe. Even my husband ate it!

To make it even lower in fat I use Egg Beaters instead of the eggs and egg whites. Could use a little more flavor - but is worth making and having as a afternoon snack!

Way too dry.

Loved this low-fat cake. I tried baking it in a bundt cake pan, and it turned out beautifully. At the end we added a peanut butter frosting drizzle on top, followed by chocolate syrup drizzle. Beautiful. I also used about 1/4 cup extra of apple sauce and it was moist beyond compare.

I am in search of lowfat fun food because my toddler has a cholesterol problem- this was a huge hit with all of her ballet class! Moms all asked for recipe

I made this cake with high hopes and was not completely disappointed. It came out a little dry, so next time I may add a bit more oil or applesauce. Another option can be to add some of the chocolate chopped (in addition to the melted), so that you have some extra moist spots. I added walnuts for a brownie-esque flavor. When serving, I poured a little milk on it and warmed it up in the microwave. It helped a lot with the dryness. Overall, a satisfying low-fat recipe.

I love this recipe. I own a small cafe/bistro, and everytime that I make this cake, it sells outs so quickly. I usually wait until someone tastes the flavour, then mention the low fat and they are sold forever. I changed it slightly by adding 2 TBSP. of coffee syrup, which intensifies the chocolate flavour.

I am so happy to make this "rich, moist, and delicious" cake for my boyfriend's birthday without any test :) He loved it! I used a pottery bundt instead of springform pan and put more than 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts and it still came out great. I love kind of bitter taste, but it has an excellent combination with vanilla custard sauce from epicurious! You can use left over 2 yolks for half of the recipe. Try it!

This cake rates 4 stars. It is delicious!! Much better than similar chocolate cakes which are heavy tasting and high-fat. I added 1/4 cup of coarsely chopped walnuts to the batter and it came out great. Even better served with lowfat whipped cream. Hard to believe it's comparatively low in fat. I'll definitely make this again!

This is one of the few cakes which turns out to be fabulous using gluten-free flour (I'm wheat intolerant) - in fact it was so delicious it has become a great dinner-party dessert as everyone seems to like chocolate (and nobody would ever tell it was not made with normal flour). I do cheat a bit by filling it with chocolate butter icing and topping it with ganache, and serving it with icecream.....! but I always freeze the extra portions so we're not having it too often! The applesauce idea works really well - not something I have come across before in the UK: I think this substitution must have developed in the US. Four forks plus to this recipe!

This is an absolutely great cake considering it is a lower-fat type using applesauce in place of some fat. I think the combination of cocoa and melted chocolate is what creates the really deep chocolate flavor. My husband, who automatically dismisses any lower-fat dessert, actually LIKES this!
