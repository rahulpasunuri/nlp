not four stars simply because it is as Salt Lake City said, crisp, clean, simple and fresh, But not an over the top WOW. I use it often though because it is fresh and tasty. (maybe I should have just written ditto to Salt Lake City!)

This is crisp, clean, and good. Simple but fresh and tasty.

Be sure to add the oil SLOWLY or the the mixture will "break". This is delicious and easy.
