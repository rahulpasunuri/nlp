Based on another's review, I also sauteed chicken in the garlic/oil and added that...good combination! Thanks, everyone!

Just as cwiertal posted, I also think this is a good base. Each individual should tweek it to suit their own tastes. I chose to use 1/2 cup of beef broth instead of the full cup, which would've been too much liquid. I used the one tomato I had, and in addition to the asparagus, I added fresh green beans and broccoli. Happened to have goat cheese, and based on another review, used that as well as Parmesan - what a delicious suggestion! I liked the basil but didn't have parsley. Next time I'm going to try it with onions, mushrooms, and definitely omit the tomatoes. Although I LOVE them, I was not impressed with them in this dish. Looking forward to experimenting with this! It's a keeper!

This recipe is definitely a solid starting point, good base recipe. Just reading it over I worried it may be a bit bland so I started by browning the garlic with some oil and some diced shallots, added the tomatoes and some dry vermouth, then added the rest of the ingredients including a mix of chicken and beef broth and some fresh off the cob corn and let it simmer. Ended up being deeeeeelicious. I agree with some of the other comments here, bland as written, but really a great base!

I made this tonight and substituted crumbled goat cheese for the Parmesan cheese. It was delicious!

I used Mushroom with this recipe. Lots and lots of Mushrooms. My wife said it was great I agree.

This was very good and I think you could make the sauce ahead and reheat. I think the flavors improve with a little time.

This is a quick and easy meal. It is very tasty, and my family loved it (even my children, ages 5 and 6). I agree with some of the other reviewers, it needed a little more red pepper. Other than that, I thought it was good. I will definitely make this one again.

This one's a keeper! Easy and fast to make, and we thought it was delicious. I see other reviewers thought it was bland; don't know what they were expecting but the fresh basil with fresh asparagus and taste of cheese was yummy. I cut down on the garlic and the broth, so maybe that helped bring the taste of the vegetables forward. I'm sure we'll make it again.

We loved this recipe, easy and light. I used romas for the tomatoes. This is a real winner

If you are looking for new ways to have your favorite vegatables included in this recipe, then you should try it! It was even better on the following day. I made it with the whole wheat penne and it was very good. Also, please do not substitute fresh tomato sauce. It is so much better than using canned tomatos.

This was an easy vegetable dish, but nothing that special. The red pepper and the garlic really make the dish -- my boyfriend and I increased the amounts. I'd like to try experimenting with different kinds of cheese.

A nice light healthy & easy dinner. What more could you ask for. I will add more than a pinch of pepper flakes next time. I definetly plan to make this again.

I love this dish, and have already made it a few times. It's very light and healthy. I saute the asparagus for a few minutes with the garlic to sear the flavor before I add the broth. I've also added some cooked chicken breast, which fits in great.

I'm a cook who likes to experiment and loves spices. I used roasted red peppers peeled and cut into strips instead of crushed red pepper. I added sliced fresh mushrooms and vadalia onions slice into strips. I then added 1 tsp. of McCormicks Vegetable Supreme seasoning and 1 tsp. of Knorrs Alfredo sauce mix plus 1/2 tsp. of corn starch mixed with two tblsp. of water. The family just loved the dish and went back for seconds.

If you're expecting to be blown away by the flavor of this dish, you're going to be disappointed. The reviews are pretty clear. I used beef broth, extra garlic, and extra herbs (a combination of fresh and dried). You really must add the fresh basil and parsley at the end and don't skimp. This dish had a very nice, very light, fresh quality to it. If you're in the mood for that, you won't be disappointed.

I made this dish with broccoli. It worked great. The asparagus was expansive. If you can use all fresh herbs it works great. (we had a garden full of them).

the parsley and fresh basil add a fresh taste, but it does not make up for the blandness of the dish. beef stock is a must and i doubled the parsley round 2.

I don't know what all the fuss it about. This was just plain blah and I would not make it again.

WE PREFER THIS W/ BEEF BROTH RATHER THAN CHICKEN BROTH, BUT OTHERWISE THE WHOLE FAMILY LOVES ASAPARAGUS PREPARED THIS WAY.

Really yummy! I used fresh grated parmesan and asiago cheese and dried basil instead of fresh (just as good). Simple and fresh. Great with a green salad.
