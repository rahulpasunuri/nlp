You'll either love or hate these bars. I made them exactly as directed but they looked bland, so before serving I drizzled bittersweet chocolate and toasted coconut on top. The base is very cake-like. I prefer a dense, flakey base commonly associated with bars. Also, they are very sweet and loaded with vanilla. I would cut the vanilla in the base in half. My co-workers who have a real sweet tooth loved them, but I was disappointed.

This recipe is a classic. The only change is the shortbread needes gnot granulated sugar, but POWDERED sugar. This Cristmas season I have made this recipe 5 times in batches of 4 each time--YUMBO.

Melbourne, how long did you cook the caramel? I wish recipes like this would either say how long to cook the mixture or, better yet, specify a temperature on the candy thermometer. "Until it turns a golden caramel" is too subjective.

This recipe was just so so. I poured the sugar and corn syrup onto the batter, but there was no way this was going to set, even if I had left it for one week. I decided to put it back into the oven with the syrup on and cook a further 20 minutes. The syrup went right into the slice, it was very sweet. This slice needs lots of cream to break down the sweetness.
