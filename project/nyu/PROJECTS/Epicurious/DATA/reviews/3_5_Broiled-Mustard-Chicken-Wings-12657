I did what sudsmoo did (02/02/07) and used the boneless breast instead. It was so good. My husband loved it too. Easy to make and nice taste.

Forget chicken wings; use boneless breasts. Broil about 6 min. per side; slater on lots of mustard then bread crumbs. Broil another 6+ minutes. My horribly picky eater grandchildren always ask for this. Serve with the orzo and radish salad on this site.

Easy Delicious and Fast!!! I didn't have mustard seed so I just added the breadcrumbs and it was still delicious

Everyone, including my 2 toddlers, loved this recipe! It was so easy to make and delicious. The kids even helped cook it.

This recipe was delicious. I followed the recipe exactly (rare for me) and they were perfect. I will definitely make them again. Nice and easy! Just what you need when you have a toddler running around.

Yum, yum, yum! I was tempted to ignore the crumb topping in order to save time, but I'm definitely glad I followed the recipe intact. The topping was excellent, and the wings turned out very nicely. (In fact, I liked them enough that I make them now as a main course for casual family dinners.)

I used sour cream instead of yogurt as well and I didn't have any bread crumbs so I skipped the breadcrumb sprinkle/oil drizzle step. These were very yummy regardless. I've also made honey mustard wings by adding a few tablespoons of honey to the marinade. Very tasty. We liked them so much we doubled the recipe last time we made it.

Good mild flavor, but a little dry. Maybe using a baking bag of some sort would help. I should note that although we really enjoy wings and eat them quite often - they are usually fried. In general I don't think baked wings are as good as fried.

I prepared this recipe for Christmas dinner. It was complimented by many. The cooking time was a bit off but I made the right adjustments. I would definitely make it again.

This was a very easy and delicious dish. I didn't have yogurt on hand so I substituted sour cream and it came out just great.

I made these for my family and we all thought that they were really good
