I freaking love this soup!!! I first had it a party and the girl who brought it happened to bring copies of the recipe to the party. I found myself thinking about the soup and how tasty it was, and I endeavored to make the recipe. I don't cook complex recipes very often, but this so much easier and straight forward than I anticipated. The hardest part is just chopping the mirepoix. My home smelled crazy amazing during the process. I have been caught licking the food processor blade. The taste is of intense sweet corn enhanced by the right seasonings. You don't even need fresh or special corn, plain frozen grocery store brand will sparkle like it has never has before. I am crazy for corn, and if you don't think corn is one of food's most satisfying flavors, perhaps this won't do as much for you. But my boyfriend, who is a more corn-nuetral than I am, also loves this soup, and doesn't mind just having this soup by itself for dinner. I love the soup so much that I don't want to eat anything else along side it. For protein, I add some boiled turkey keilbasa to the finished soup to make it a one pot meal.

I used a bit of cold pressed hemp oil in the end to give it a bit of omega's 3 and 6. I also used half the cream and omitted the bell pepper using half of a de-seeded jalapeno instead. After blending I ran it through a strainer to get the kernel hulls out for that smooth consistency. I'll top it with tiny pieces of rendered bacon, fresh chive and a dollop of creme fraiche.

Very nice flavours. I used fresh local corn and grilled it and fresh rosemary. I also followed the recommendations of some to strain. This greatly reduced the volume of soup but it left a lovely texture. The major addition I made was bacon. I rendered the bacon in the pot, drained all but about 1 tbsp of the fat and used this to sauté the carrot, onion and celery. Later, I minced the bacon and used it as a garnish with fresh chives. I also added a little butter to the stock... hey you need some butter with corn, right? It all worked well and I would do it again.

Four forks when the 2 cups of reserved corn kernals added at the end are fresh not frozen (otherwise followed recipe as written). Just a wonderful simple and delicious soup. A good option for everyday eating and for guests.

I used many of the suggestions by other reviewers, including adding some garlic to the sauteed vegetables, and in addition to the cayenne, I used a bit of nutmeg to compliment the sweetness of the corn. This was one of the best soups I've ever had!

Thanks to the previous reviewers, this soup came out pretty good! I followed jessic2952's advice and cut down to 5 cups of stock, mschlock's advice of straining the mixture was brilliant (as I prefer the fancy restaurant style, less fibrous as well), substituted cayenne pepper for powdered chipotle pepper powder, and got a jar of Trader Joe's roasted bell peppers and threw it into the blender..Great result! I think it needs another herb--not sure what..Next time I'm going to throw in some roasted poblano peppers! I'll let you know how that comes out!

Fantastic! I made it for soup night with a bunch of girlfriends and everyone loved it. I substituted whole milk for the half and half to cut a few calories. I also used Kitchen Basics seafood stock instead of chicken--a great, yummy change.

MY HUSBaND THOUGHT IT'S THE BEST SOUP EVER. I THOUGHT IT WaS VERY TASTY MYSELF.

Excellent! I used fresh corn that I cut off the cob. I "cooked" the cobs, along with the other veggies, then discarded the cobs prior to pureeing. I used fat-free half & half. I did not have a red pepper, but the soup was excellent anyway. I will make sure to have a pepper on hand next time I make this.

Love this! I have made it over and over and it is a huge hit. The only change I make is I do not add the cream. Once you puree the corn and broth after cooking, it is creamy on it's own.

Rating: 4
This recipe exceeded my expectations!! Unlike other reviewers, I did not think the bisque was too spicy, it was perfect. The red bell pepper added such a wonderful flavor as well. I used an immersion blender so I wouldn't have to work in batches. It was a little soupier than I prefer so next time I am going to cut down to just 5 cups of stock. Delicious!! A definite keeper.

Delicious AFTER I fried up and added sliced spicy chorizo to the soup and let sit overnight in the fridge!

Made this because I had leftover corn on the cob from a family gathering. Used fresh rosemary and added a tsp of fresh thyme. Also threw in some roasted garlic that I had sitting around. Used 1/2 C. fat free half and half instead of 1 C. "full fat" half and half. Would definitely make again.

i have made this soup many times. the first was the first course of a birthday dinner for my friend. i altered it by adding a whole head of roasted garlic, using a tbsp of fresh rosemary instead of dried, and subbing home made veggie stock for the chicken stock (my friend is a vegetarian). this was exactly what i was looking for. i prefer eating it with crackers.

Rating: 3
This is tasty stuff. I recommend forcing the soup through a strainer once the pureeing is done and before adding the whole corn kernels. As written, it was a little fibrous for my taste; after straining, it was very close to the fancy corn bisque you find in restaurants. I substituted thyme for rosemary (not a big fan of rosemary). Fresh cracked black pepper is also a must. Good stuff!

Rating: 4
I followed this recipe to the letter with one exception. I used 1/8th teaspoon of cayenne pepper since some of the children at the thanksgiving table were pepper-phobic. It was a great hit and we are having it again this year!

Rating: 4
I've made this "as is" and it was excellent, creamy and simple. But the flavors really deepen when you roast all the vegetables, use fresh rosemary, and substitute chili peppers for the cayenne (a dollop of diced jalapenos - canned or fresh - or serranos work nicely). I also used an immersion blender - a wee bit chunkier, but didn't have to blend in batches.

Rating: 4
Halved the amount of 1/2 and 1/2, still very creamy and satisfying. Omitted celery, doubled carrots. This was hearty, healthy, tasty! Relatively low effort, will make again for sure.

This dish was average. We enjoy spicey food quite a bit, but agree the cayenne kick is a bit much here - too much for the other delicate flavors. The corn, red bell pepper and rosemary are nice together, but all in all there are better bisques for similar effort.

Since we're having the exquisite Butternut Squash Gratin with Rosemary Breadcrumbs as a side dish this Thanksgiving, I needed to depart from our usual pumpkin or squash soup for our first course. After auditioning this alternative last night for my husband, we agreed we've found a winner. Made with Trader Joe's Organic Supersweet corn, this dish was delightfully satisfying, sweet with a bit of peppery kick, and beautifully golden-colored, flecked with the bits of sauteed red pepper. Considering the low proportion of cream and butter to other ingredients, this bisque tasted surprisingly rich and creamy without being overly filling. Like others, I used an immersion blender in the pot before adding the balance of the corn and the red pepper. Tasted even better today, after flavors married in the fridge overnight, and I'm a huge proponent of do-ahead whenever possible. Sure to delight the palates of our Thanksgiving guests this year. An excellent outcome for minimal time and effort.

I made this recently using vegetable broth instead of chicken broth, since several vegetarians were included in the guests coming over for a holiday dinner. I was not happy with the flavor upon completion, it was too bland, something was missing. So, I added some clam juice (1 bottle), chopped sea clams (30 ozs) and a bit of liquid smoke, but was still not happy, and put it in the refrigerator overnight. That refrigerated rest made all the difference - the flavors really melded. I served it the following evening, a wonderful corn clam bisque that received many kudos and arguments over who could take home the leftovers!

This recipe gets rave reviews every time I serve it. I make the soup up through the puree stage then freeze it until I need it (usually 1-2 weekends before Thanksgiving or whatever). Then defrost in the fridge and finish it the night before or in the morning.

This was very tasty, with a nice sweet\spicy contrast to it. I used veg broth, fresh rosemany, and omitted the celery. I do think that it tasted better a few hours later, the corn flavor came through much better after it had cooled down once.

Just an excellent recipe. I used fresh instead of frozen corn. It is definitely a keeper,

This dish was great. The spicyness was just right. The only thing I did differently was I used two bell peppers, pureeing one of them with the vegetables.

This was a hit at my annual Jack-o-Lantern carving party: fresh, flavorful, fantastic. In the future, I will use a tad LESS cayenne, as I think the amount suggested was too bold for the elegant red bell peppers and creamed corn: It was too spicy for me (and I love spicy foods), but luckily it didn't have that painful afterkick. The heat of the cayenne did mellow after each taste. A terrific, easy dish that really hits the spot.

This is a fabulous recipe. After 50 years of NE clam chowdah, this is now our traditional Thanksgiving soup. We modified it with roasted red peppers (not from a jar, ugh!) and a tad more cayenne for ZIP. I could eat this once a week. Oink

I enjoyed this soup, but next time I would roast the red pepper to give it more flavor and I would strain it before adding the final ingredients to give it a more velvety base. I think I would prefer thyme to rosemary in this dish, but that's just my preference. I'd like to try it with fresh, roasted corn, since the frozen corn, tasted a lot like a pureed can of creamed corn. That's tasty enough, but it lacked a home made quality.

I strayed from all my usual dishes for Thanksgiving this year and used recipes off this site for all my new dishes. This is definitely my fav!!!! Added crawfish tails which really made the bisque. Not all my other dishes went over well, but this one has already been requested again!!!

I make this soup on a weekly basis, it is by far the most tasty and interesting I've ever made. I use less half and half, and I don't puree it but rather use the immersion blender and leave it quite chunky. Fabulous.

This was excellent; had a nice kick to it. It was also very easy to make. I served it for a Thanksgiving appetizer and garnished with a swirl of roasted, peeled, seeded and pureed red bell pepper with a little olive oil.

Very nice soup. Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving dinner. Guests ranged in age from 93 years down to 5 years of age. Everyone enjoyed it. Was wondering if anyone has made it with fresh rosemary or tried to add a little bacon? For first time makers, the amount of corn is 4 regular size boxes of frozen corn. My local store did not have any bags of corn. I was transporting the soup so after doing the puree and adding the half and half and the corn kernels, I just added the sauted red pepper and transferred it to a container. Be careful when reheating the soup. The pot my mother in law had was not as heavy as the pot I had used and it started to stick.

Rating: 4
Outstanding soup. Everyone asks for this to start our Thanksgiving meal (since the one year I strayed and everyone was disappointed!). I use vegetable broth to accommodate vegetarians, It makes a hearty soup to help fill up the non-turkey eaters, while not too heavy for the rest of us. I have occasionally substituted skim milk for some of the cream, but obviously it's not as rich. (Besides, it's Thanksgiving, so go for it!

My family loves this! They insist I make it every year for Thanksgiving -- even my mother who doesn't like corn. Its easy enough to make every day though. I substitute vegetable broth for chicken broth and it works just as well.

This soup was a crowd pleaser - everyone at the table asked for seconds. It has a wonderful, delicate flavor with a little kick at the end from the cayenne pepper. I grilled fresh corn because I had it, but I think the soup would still be good (and much quicker) with the frozen corn the recipe calls for.

The family loved this soup and would like it as a meal by itself. I made it as a first course with the thanksgiving dinner. The spiciness from the cayenne was very good. Even with all the steps it was well worth the effort. Being able to make it the day before the dinner was beneficial.

we've made this soup for the past two thanksgivings, and i'm suprised that an earlier reviewer called it bland. perhaps it depends on the type of corn and stock you use. we've generally used frozen, sweet white corn, and knor vegetarian vegetable bullion, and it is just heavenly.

This was really a jewel and very simple to make for an inexperienced wanna be chef. Everybody loved it. Because I am lactose intolerant and can never order cream soups in a restaurant as it causes me to bloat I used Lactoce free reduced calore milk and it still tased great but not as rich.

I'm making this bisque again by popular demand this Thanksgiving! Very easy, even for beginners like me, and the taste is wonderful!

This bisque is uniquely versatile; a perfect beginning to any meal or as a stand alone light entree when paired with a salad and crusty bread. I found that the fat content can be easily lowered without sacrificing its complexity of flavors by substituting evaporated milk for the cream. Try adding some diced cajun chicken breast or spiced steamed shrimp to round out the bisque even more!
