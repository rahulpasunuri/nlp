A great, quick and easy one! I have made it 3 times so far. Twice I used beer because I was out of wine. The first time it was great using Heineken. The second time I used a much stronger beer and we didn't care for it at all. I then made it with the white wine and it was also great. I omit the caraway since my husband is not a fan. I had sauteed the onions the first time but have found there is no need too.

Smoked the sausage before making the recipe. Barb thought the sausage was the best she has ever had. Added chopped apples to the kraut. Delicious.

This is my Girlfriends new favorite recipe. I added Mustard and used beer like the past reviews suggested. I also threw in some Dill for a little punch.

I think adding the hot mustard as someone suggested was a very good addition. I didn't have any white wine on hand, so I used beer instead, still came out good. To make it last a little longer I added slices of red potato right at the begining. I think this recipe came out very good. I would definitely make it again.

Someone said this dish was slightly bland, so I added a little more caraway seeds and a dash of dry mustard. It was great! I couldn't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day! I definitely recommend it.

THIS RECIPE SMELLED WONDERFUL WHILE IT WAS COOKING BUT PRESENTED ITSELF AS A SLIGHTLY BLAND ENTREE.
