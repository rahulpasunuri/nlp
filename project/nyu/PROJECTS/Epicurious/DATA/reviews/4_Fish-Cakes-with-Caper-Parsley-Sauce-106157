Awesome! We used hake instead of halibut (less $$/pound). Also, used panko bread crumbs otherwise sardines, anchovies as called for--don't skip it! Chablis as a matching wine was very yummy. We served it for 8 as a fish course-just the right serving size.

This is a good recipe. A few suggestions - make sure the green onions are finely chopped, and I thought a cup was a bit too much. Do NOT skip the sardines! When chopped finely and mixed in they do not make the dish fishy at all, but they do add depth of flavor. Similarly, the sauce makes the dish - don't skip it! It is similar to a caesar dressing - the anchovies aren't overpowering, but are an important flavor element. Lastly, I put in the egg before the breadcrumbs (I used panko) so that I could judge how much panko to use and achieve just the right consistency for making patties.

Yum! Would not have thought fish cakes would be very good, but these were great. Did not include the sardines, but kept everything else the same. Leftover cakes the next day were very good too.

Excellent dish. The grocery store was out of halibut so I used tuna steaks and everything came out just fine. I also doubled the garlic and doubled the amount of caper-parsley sauce.

"Fish cake" sounds intrinsically unappetizing but this was completely outstanding. I ended up flaking leftover scallops, swordfish and whitefish from a broiled seafood plate instead of fresh haddock, then followed the rest of the recipe. This is one of the best recipes I've made from epicurious!!

Quite good. Next time I will add a bit more egg to moisten the mixture so that it holds together better. I will also try a tbsp. of dijon mustard for more kick. My wife liked it better than crab cakes. I used fresh tilapia instead of the halibut. Much cheaper and a mild fish. After all, it's being used in a cake.

These were delicious! Be careful not to use really dried-out bread (as I did). Also, be careful not too add too much parsley in the heat of the moment. I didn't make the sauce, but I will next time. Don't skip the sardines.

i made these again, with the sauce this time. outstanding!!! a couple of things. do not skip the zest, i used meyer lemon zest and omg, delish times a thousand. and i suggest using the oven instead of stovetop. i did half each way and the oven came out better. less calories that way too since you don't have to saute in oil. please make these. you will definitely love them!

i just made this using left over tilapia with lemon pepper seasoning. i nixed the sardines, flour and the egg but used a wee bit of milk to moisten. the cakes stayed together pretty well, didn't crumble like i thought they might. but they were absolutely delish! super easy, i whipped it up in like 10 minutes flat. but as i said, the fish was already cooked previously. and i used panko. will definitely make again!

WOW, I made this for my wife (who is NOT a fish person) and she loved it. There is a great amount of flavor in this dish. I even left out the sardines to cut down on the fishyness and I thought I would be sacrificing flavor but it was terrific!!!

I'm not a fish eater, but made these for my boyfriend using fresh haddock. Followed the recipes exactly except I used regular old breadcrumbs. My boyfriend said they were "outstanding", and better than crab cakes. He ate them all by himself in 2 days. Sauce was fantastic. This was so easy, and got me many "bonus points", I will be making them again very soon.

I make it as written. I've made it a lot of times for our restaurant and people just rave and rave about these fish cakes. I serve them with a home made tartar sauce from this site and I think that they are very good. I really think that the sardines are the secret between good fishcakes and really great fishcakes.

These fish cakes are perfect for lent menus. I was surfing to find some new ideas for Ash Wednesday (us traditional Mexican catholics fast in the morning and only eat fish as main course in supper). The taste is mild but great as a base for that super sauce. Maybe it was mild because I omitted the sardines - but we don't like them at home. Even so, the fish cakes turned out perfect and this recipe will definetely go to the standard lent menus for my family. My kids even ate them as sandwiches, w/out the sauce of course.

Excellent fish cakes - a bit more refined than traditional New England fish cakes. I used haddock with great results and used about 1 T. of anchovy paste in the sauce instead of the filets. Great lemony flavor. I will definitely make these again.

Wow these were grubbalicious! The sauce is the perfect complement to these tasty cakes. I like to get them good and browned on the outside so a nice crust is formed. Then with a little of the caper-parsley sauce, my mouth is very happy. I am thinking you could use any mild fish in place of the halibut.

My family raved about these tasty cakes - which I made with leftover sea bass. We wrapped them in leaves of butter lettuce and ate them like sandwiches. The one suggestion I would make is to open a window and turn on your stove fan. The fried fish smell lingered for a while.

I did use halibut for these but since I didn't have tinned sardines I used makerel instead. They were a great light lunch. I loved the parsley caper sauce. Froze leftovers,they thawed out and came out great as a starter when I had friends over. I would like to try it with sardines next time.

I used Cod Fillet and used mashed potatoes and added salt,pepper,onion and garlic powder instead of flour and sardines only because I have three boys who are fussy eaters when it comes to fish. I also deep-fryed them and the end result it was very tasty. I think the potatoes make the cakes.

Excellent. I used frozen cod, didn't add the sardines, and cut back on the oil. The fish cakes came out very elegantly. I served them with the caper sauce, using a squeeze bottle to draw a design on the plate. Will definitely make again for company and family.

This dish was outstanding. I also substituted Cod for the Halibut, and it turned out great. Other modifications included a tbsp. of dijon and about a 1/4 to 1/3 c. of chopped roasted red bell pepper. Sauce was wonderful as is and complemented to dish well... can't wait to pass it along..

Like many others, I left out the sardines because I didn't have any on hand. I used previously cooked halibut and leftover couscous instead of bread, and coated the cakes in Japanese bread crumbs, and used 2 eggs. I thought it was wonderful, especially the sauce. YUM!

I'm not a fish lover, but this dish could make one out of me. I omitted the sardines because I just don't like them. The sauce could be used for other dishes, very good. I'm thinking about trying this with shrimp in the future. It's a definite keeper.

Being the mother of three young (and picky) kids, and well aware of the health benefits of eating fish, I'm always looking for new fish recipes that I can get my family to eat. I made this last night, and all of my kids had seconds. I'll definitely make this again.

This dish is amazing! I read the previous reviews and I also skipped the sardines, upped the garlic, and had to use cod. Came out fantabulous. But I cut the recipe down by 1/3, and it still made 6 fishcakes. We're stuffed to the gills!

A wonderfully light alternative to traditionally heavy crab cakes. Although the recipe suggests making the fish cakes as a starter or a light lunch, this is definitely hearty enough for dinner. I made it for my husband last night and we both loved it. The sauce is exceptionally tasty and versatile. Will try using it on other dishes. I used 4 garlic cloves instead of 2 and I omitted the canned sardines. Would suggest making 3 cups of breadcrumbs. For a more spicy meal, I might try including jalapenos next time.

Made this last night. It was a big hit and allowed me to stay on my Mediterranean diet. I could not get halibut and used cod instead. I like these better than crab cakes. The sauce is GREAT!
