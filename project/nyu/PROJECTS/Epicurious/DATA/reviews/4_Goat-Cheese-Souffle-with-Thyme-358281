recipe calls for 1 cup of goat cheese......and it also asks for 4 ounces of goat cheese... is this a typo? which amount is correct? I did this recipe and 4 ounces is not enough to give a taste of goat cheese. I beleive 4 ounces is half a cup, right? and 8 ounces is 1 cup, right? Because this recipe and the goat cheese measurement is typed exactly the same way in the cook book??

I have made this 3 times, and it turned out beautifully each time. I made this in a standard souffle dish. A couple of tips: don't over-fold the egg whites into the mixture, and don't overcook it...it should be a little jiggly in the middle.

Delicious! But, next time I would cut back on salt. Otherwise, fabulous as is.

Incredibly rich (even using 1% milk) with a wonderful crust and fluffy, feather-light texture inside. Used Boucheron goat cheese which was excellent, 4 egg whites instead of 6 and made the bechamel according to Alice Waters' technique in The Art of Simple Food with a low simmer for 10 minutes stirring occasionally. Next time would serve for 6-8 people as very rich or make in small ramekins (bake at 400F for 10 min) and serve with a big salad and/or fruit as well as toast as too rich to eat alone.

Made this with Blue Cheese instead of the goat cheese and also added rosemary. Went over very well with several people asking for the recipe.

This sounds great! I wish I had seen it when putting together a brunch menu earlier. Can anyone report on how it works with individual ramekins? http://tbonesandtofu.wordpress.com/2011/03/13/inspired-brunch-gourmet-at-home/

wonderful dish! The flavors were delicious and the texture was perfect- soft and fluffy, with little bits of goat cheese to surprise you. The tip about baking it in a gratin dish was brilliant- the wider, flatter shape made it bake evenly, even at high altitude (which sometimes causes problems with souffles). I've had less than fabulous results with some souffle recipes, but this one made me feel quite triumphant!

I've been making this for years from Madison's cookbook. It's never failed, always impressive, tastes delightful, and even reheats well the next day. I love it with a tomato salad or tomato bruschetta.

Rated terrific by three-out-of-three diners. Savory & light. Suggest big salad and/or fruit to accompany. Made one change, using shallot (had it handy) instead of onion in the half & half. Used a classic souffle dish on the second-rack-of-four in the oven, counting down from the top slot - souffle rose high enough to brush the top heating element. Beautiful out of the oven. Will do again!
