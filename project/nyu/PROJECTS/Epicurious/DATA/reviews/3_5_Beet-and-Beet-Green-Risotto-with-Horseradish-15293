I loved this risotto when I first made it but the leftovers were not that great. It has a really strong beet taste which I can still remember vividly months later.

PS to my last post: I think if you wait to put the beets in until the rice is almost done. If the beets get too mushy, they aren't as flavorful!

I've made this many times over the last few years, and always to great accolades. This recipe is great, but you have to start with really delicious beets! I use organic and they make all the difference. Can't stress that enough. Also make my own veggie stock, so don't believe that you have to use chicken stock to give it flavor. I also don't cook the beet greens in the risotto, but make a bed of them and spoon the risotto over, just so they wilt slightly, but still impart lots of fresh crunch. I made this last night for a neighborhood potluck, and several people said they don't like beets but LOVED this dish - even asked to take some leftovers with them! And these are traditional, hard-core meat-eaters.

I've made this recipe several times and always enjoyed it. I love being able to buy a bunch of beets and using almost everything! Most recently I made the risotto with barley and chicken stock instead of water and an extra 2T of red wine vinegar. It turned out very well- the barley made the dish heartier and healthier. Only drawback was that cooking time was greatly extended.

We loved this recipe. Prepared it as written except for using 1/2 c white wine and 3 1/2 c chicken broth as many other reviewers suggested. Fabulous - creamy yet tangy.

This was interesting. I feel that the beets are too mild so you mostly end up tasting the cheese and rice--which is not a bad thing! Risotto is alway delicious. I just think this is not particularly delicious. That's why there are so many reviews calling for something more. It needs the horseradish, lemon, vinegar, whatever. Some oomph. but the color is beautiful and if you want a change of pace, it is with trying.

This was very tasty. After reading other reviews, I made the following changes when I made it: 1. Cooked the beets first in boiling water, peeled them, and added them at the same time as the beet greens (about 5 mins from the end). 2. Added two cloves of chopped garlic at the same time as the beet stems. 3. Instead of water, used 3/4 cup white wine first, and then 5 cups of simmering water with 1 tsp salt. 4. Added 1 tbsp cider vinegar towards the end. The vinegar definitely added flavor, but I wouldn't add more than that. Overall, a great meal to use up some of our CSA veggies with a salad on the side.

Ok I am back. Tried this again and this time added a little red wine vinegar...maybe 1 or 2 Tbs..easier to say "to taste". It made a big difference. Seems like that is the missing ingredient we have all been searching for. Also made a soup out of leftovers, adding chicken broth. This was good, as I anticipated.I think it could have been veg broth or even water and worked just as well.

Rating: 2
This was good - borderline delicious. Agree with all those who suggested salt and using at least some broth. Also added a little garlic but I put garlic in everything. Still feel it needs something. I wonder if a little touch of vinegar would help - rice or red wine. Just an idea for another time. I am thinking too that the leftovers could be thinned (with broth or water) and served as a soup.Will try and report.

Really delicious! Like that it uses all of the beet, because I wasn't sure what to do with the stems and greens. I used homemade chicken broth instead of water and added a little white wine.

As I was preparing this recipe, my husband was panicking. He doesn't like beets, let alone, the stems and leaves. He was amazed that it all reduced down to a beautiful and colorful risotto. Let liked it and said, save that recipe, I will eat it again.

A wonderful way to use both the beets and the greens from my CSA. I didn't have horseradish, so I threw in about a quarter cup of crumbled Roquefort cheese (and eliminated the parmesan) to amp up the flavor. I also used broth instead of water, and I kept a Parmesan rind simmering in it (which, in retrospect, was probably overpowered by the roquefort). Pretty quick for a risotto and a very striking presentation.

I used roughly followed the recipe but with a few twists - roasted and chopped the beets in advance (yummy and easy to peel), added a couple cloves of garlic with the onion, cooked risotto with 1/2 cup white wine to start followed by veggie broth, and added the beets and greens in the last 5-10 minutes. I loved the horseradish on top, it contrasts nicely with the sweet beets.

Rating: 3
We used golden beets and modified by using half chicken broth and half water. We also did 1/3 cup of white wine before we started with the broth. It took us a least an extra 15 minutes than what the recipe said for it to finish cooking and we tossed the beet greens in with about 5 mins to go. Would definitely make again!

Rating: 4
I was skeptical when I started this, but I had all the ingredients and needed to whip up something fast. I took another reviewers advice and added some stock (lobster and clam). I also thought the beets were too big, so I added a half cup of rice and an extra half stick of butter (oh yeah). The results were excellent.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe - so delicious and it was actually the first time I've ever cooked with beets. In fact, it was so good that I've been making it regularly for almost a year. Everyone is skeptical when I tell them about this dish, but tasting it (and seeing the striking red and green colors) wins them over. I do, however, use water flavored with veg stock cubes for a little extra oompf. Also, it takes me a heck of a lot longer to make than it would seem from the recipe but it is worth it.

Even though I was tempted to immediately change this recipe, like many other reviewers did, I decided to make it exactly as written and see if the water was as insufficient as everyone thought it might be. My family was very happy with the result. The dish was very tasty - slightly sweet and very flavorful. I do think however that I would sub broth for half of the water (definitely not all) next time to give it some depth. I had to hit it pretty hard with salt to bring the flavor up. The horseradish was awesome, too. It added zing but was mild enough to not really taste like horseradish, just additional flavor. A pretty well balanced dish. I'm certainly keeping this recipe.

Rating: 3
I only used 3/4 cup of risotto and it was enough, used stock instead of water, a little salt and pepper and some Gran Padano instead of parmesan and no horseradish (didn't have any). But I would have never thought to use beets for risotto, and it looks beautiful!

Rating: 4
really enjoyed this recipe, though i supposed i tweaked it considerably. despite others' reviews, i didn't trust the water. i substituted four cups of chicken stock instead, which made it nice and rich. i also seasoned it with oregano, which was really nice. also, everyone loved the horseradish. i got the creamy kind, and i would have made it more straight up horseradish next time. i also added about two cloves of garlic with the onion. served it at a party, and it received rave reviews.

Rating: 3
I par-boiled the beets for ease of peeling. I also added white wine to the rice as the first 1/2 cup of liquid. The horesradish at the end really enhanced the risotto. All in all the dish is creamy and flavorful. My biggest problem with it is what to serve it next to. The color is somewhat off putting, esp. next to chicken (the meat picks up the bright red color and appears raw). I will reserve it for my vegetarian friends or serve it alone as a starter.

This really is delicious! Like other reviewers, I made it with the beets from my CSA box and then made it again and again and then was disappointed when there were no more beets! I made it as written. The horseradish garnish is a delicious addition.

This was a great way to use the beets from my CSA share. I had never cooked with them before and loved this recipe. I also used a little zucchini and used wine and chicken broth rather than just water... served with a side of kale it was perfect!

3 forks is delicious. . . I wouldn't say it was exceptional, but my boyfriend who usually hates risotto gobbled it up. I did add garlic to the onions and beets and I also added white wine to the rice before adding chicken stock. I also added a little dill at the end. It was really good, but maybe I over did it a bit. . . could have used a more watered down version of chicken stock or I am even tempted to try it with the water. The horseradish was an excellent addition but took over the dill a bit. I would definitely make this again. It is a great way to use beets and the greens.

This is a real treat, though like many other reviewers, I always shock the rice with 1/2 cup dry white. Will try with pecans per smittins' review next time. Great idea.

This was surprisingly delicious. I added a pinch of salt and a grind of pepper, and that's all. Creamy, luscious, flavorful. Probably really healthy, too. Didn't have any horseradish, so I subbed wasabi, which didn't really add anything to the dish; didn't use much of it.

I am not a big beet fan, but had some leftover from my CSA share. This seemed like a good recipe for enjoying the beets without their overpowering taste. I love it! I made a bunch of substitutions -- added salt (though as with other reviewers, I think it could have used more), used cheddar instead of parmesan (no parm on hand), and omitted the horseradish. I also added a small zucchini, diced, which I threw in while the beets were sauteeing -- I didn't have enough beets and have WAY MORE than enough zukes, so it was a great substitution. Very creamy and delicious. When I eat the leftovers, I will try the horseradish. I wish my boyfriend had been here to share this!

I made the mistake of dicing the beets in too large chunks ( 1/2 inch). Beets came out undercooked. I think the beets need to be about 0.5cm. Otherwise the flavor was quite nice. I also added one chopped green garlic which I stirred in with the onions. And used chicken stock instead of water. I usually love horseradish but felt the horseradish in this dish was kind of weird- better left out.

Rating: 4
Oh YUM. Salt the onions when they go in with the butter, and this dish is excellent (I also assumed it was a typo). My boyfriend and I love both beets and horseradish, so this is a keeper. I didn't bother with a more flavorful cooking liquid than water, and I would think anything more flavor-wise would just get in the way of the beets, rice, and horseradish (which I doubled after tasting it).

This was delicious! I typically don't add salt to any of my dishes with rare exception, plus I use fresh local organic beets, so I found it to have plenty of flavor! Although I did use the wine and a combination of veggie & onion broth in place of the water, as I usually do with risotto. The parmesan was even too much salt for my taste, so I sprinkled it on top. I like my beet greens as raw as possible - these were exceptionally tender, so I made a bed of the greens and spooned the risotto over -- perfect! Then I tossed a few toasted pecans on top. The finale was I made my own horseradish sauce with creme fraiche, sour cream, dill and a little lemon added to the fresh grated horseradish from my local organic farm! YUMMMMMY! And a gorgeous dish to boot!

This is a lot better than it sounds. And let me tell you, the horseradish is a MUST. Without it it is dull as dishwater. With it, it is good. Even my 10-year old daughter agreed. But I'd say 1 T per serving!

Great recipe! I modified a bit by using 3 cups vegetable broth instead of water, and using about 1/2 cup of dry white wine to deglaze the risotto/onion mixture. I also used half olive oil and half butter. Finally I added a couple of pinches of sea salt and a few grinds of pepper. My boyfriend and I thought this was a great summer treat, but also thought it would be a fantastic side in the fall with a roasted chicken or lamb chop.

Delicious with some slight modifications. I added a pinch of salt while sauteing the beets, used chicken broth instead of water and added wine to deglaze the rice. Even my beet phobic husband liked it.

I've made this dish numerous times, in its original form and with modifications. I always use veggie or chicken stock, and a half-cup of dry white wine. My favorite version of the recipe skips the horseradish, and adds a couple pinches of nutmeg and/or a pinch of cayenne pepper. My beet-averse husband gobbles this down.

This is beautiful and delicious! I made it with a sweet onion and with chicken broth instead of water. Didn't need to salt it for flavor at all. In fact, I forgot to add the parmesan, and it was still creamy, rich, and delicious. One tip: Don't add the beet greens as early as the recipe calls for. Wait until the rice is almost ready and then stir in the greens until they're wilted. That way, they retain their beautiful green color in the midst of all that rich red. Yum. Can't wait to go home and eat the leftovers!

We've made this twice, and agree with a previous reviewer -- it needs salt! That said, we think it's a marvelous dish. Rather than using the butter as called for, I sauteed the onion & beets in olive oil, then added a table spoon of butter at the very end for richness. I also used chicken broth, rather than water.

This dish is pretty and rather interesting but missing something. Maybe pinenuts? We made it with vegetable stock instead of water which I think only helped but I don't think I'll make this one again unless I'm snowbound in a house and down to my last bunch of beets and cup of arborio rice.

NEEDS SALT! This dish is delicious, but Gourmet's usually infallible copyeditor must have been out sick the day it went to press. You need to add some salt (about 1/2 - 3/4 tsp) when you are sauteing the vegetables and rice, and about the same amount again before you add the cheese. I'd bet the people who thought it was "bland" didn't salt it--not their fault! With salt, it is subtle, earthy, and delicious. Good either with or without the horseradish.

Rating: 3
I really enjoy this recipe. A while back I bought beets for the first time without any idea how I would make them. Then I came across this recipe. Its appearance is beautiful if you use red beets, and I really appreciate that the recipe uses every bit of the beet--except the peeling. My suggestion is to use more parmesan cheese and have the horseradish on the side so that you can add some at the table. This isn't what I would call an exciting dish. But it's a good dish. Its flavors are subtle and work well with each other.

I am not a fan of beets, generally, but I had a dish like this in a restaurant and it was excellent. So I hunted down this recipe and made a few substitutions - chicken broth instead of plain water, a little more fresh parmesan than was called for, and some snips of fresh kale. I also left the horseradish to be put on individually. The result was absolutely top notch and I will make it again - tonight! This would be a beautiful dish for the holidays.

Hmm. I had mixed feelings about trying this due to the previous reviews. However, I am always looking for ways to use beet greens and my husband loves horseradish. I used organic chiogga beets so the color was pale pink-not too pretty. Also not very beet-y tasting. I am glad I did not add the horseradish to the entire dish-my husband added some to his own bowl. It was not good with the horseradish!! Keep trying, Epicurious.

I have to confess: maybe I just don't like beets. However, I had a fresh bunch from the farmer's market and decided to try this recipe. It is absolutely beautiful as far as presentation goes, and I really wish I liked it, because I think it would be a lovely addition to a meal for friends. But I just thought it was bland- I did substitute chicken broth for most of the water and used olive oil instead of butter, but I just didn't care for the taste at all. My husband, who is not a picky eater, thought it was ok but wouldn't want to eat it again, either.

Fresh baby beets with luscious greens have just come into our market, and I was looking for something new to do with them. This deep red risotto is our favorite beet recipe to date. Like another reviewer, I substituted chicken broth for the water. I also reduced the butter to 2 Tbsp. and added 1 Tbsp. olive oil. Still rich and wonderful.

I like horseradish, I LOVE beets, why didn't I like this recipe??? This was very disappointing -after reading the other favorable reviews, I was anxious to make it. We found the texture strange and the taste stranger. The taste is probably best in limited quantities (no way should this be an entree) and it requires substantial prep time. There are many other (better) risotto recipes on this site. Try the wild mushroom risotto. Now THAT's worth it. I will not make this one again.

I had my doubts about this dish, but it was wonderful. A great vegetarian main dish, a wonderful way to use those beautiful fresh beets I see at the farmer's market. I especially love the horseradish--a great touch. Just be sure to season (salt and pepper) this dish at some point.

As an avid dinner entertainer I consult Epicurious each and every time I plan a special dinner to assemble my own tasty menu, but have yet to invest the time to come back after the event and rate the recipes.... UNTIL NOW! So, for all you cooks who like an elegant dinner party menu, try this Beet Risotto with Salmon Wellington (Bon Appetit 1999) as I recently did for an unusually delicious Spring dinner (for eight). The Risotto can be made ahead (as well as the Salmon), transferred to a covered casserole dish and reheated at 350 for approx. 30 min. After reheating, stir in the parmesan and sprinkle freshly grated horseradish on top (don't mix in). It is worth the trouble to buy the whole root and grate the horseradish yourself (I used a food processor) as the freshness is an awesome compliment to the Salmon. My guests raved about the Risotto from the very first bite -all had seconds! It also made for an exquisite presentation. I steamed fresh Asparagus for the vegetable side. This is a keeper and is an all season show stopper. (p.s. I recommend triple rinsing the greens and stems...my beets were as sandy as spinach and you definitely don't want any grit)
