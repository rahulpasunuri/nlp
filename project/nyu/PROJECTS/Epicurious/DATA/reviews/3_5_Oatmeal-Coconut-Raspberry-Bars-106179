Wish I'd read some reviews before making these -- I agree 100% that they could have a LOT less sugar and be better for it. i.e. unsweetened coconut AND/OR a spread that's not as sugary as jam. I think I'll try an experiment with some kind of spread made from fresh cranberries next time (not dried - they also have a lot of sugar) The recipe is a good starting point.

Will become a staple recipe for school snacks. Changed a few things: 1 cup unsweetened coconut instead of sweetened (toasted about 3 minutes - watch carefully!!), cut butter by 2 TBL, no white sugar, half whole wheat flour and half white (will add more whole wheat flour next time). After dough formed in food processor, I added the oats and ALL coconut and pulsed a few times to help with mixing and finished by hand. Melted jam to make it easy to spread. Fantastic.

Rating: 3
I made this without the coconut and sprinkled a little powdered sugar over the top for affect. When I was younger I had a dessert called Cranberry Crunch. It is the same recipe without the coconut and uses a can of cranberry sauce instead of the raspberry jam. A bit less sweet than the raspberry jam and delicious!

I've been making these 1 - 2 times per year for several years and they always turn out great! It's a very popular treat for family & friends (will be for New Year's party this year). The only change I've made it to use more coconut on top and more of the seedless jam.

Rating: 4
These were such a hit! I followed the advice and omitted the white sugar and used a premium raspberry jam that had seeds but they were completely unnoticable once it was cooked. Once the dough was prepped, it didn't look like enough to cover the pan so I used a 9" X 9". The bars came out about an inch thick and very chewy. Amazing. Making it again tomorrow.

these bars are delicious! i added some chocolate chips (just a light sprinkling on top) -- definitely not necessary, but good.

I just made these today and they were delicious! I cut out the white sugar and only used 1/2 cup of brown sugar. They were the perfect sweetness. I lined the pan with aluminum foil for easy removal and I covered the pan with aluminum foil for half of the baking time so the coconut on the top wouldn't burn. Overall, really, really good :)

Oops, sorry, that's 1 1/4 STICKS of butter, not 1 1/4 cups!

Rating: 3
I liked these and they were simple to make. After reading what other reviewers suggested, I used only 1/2 a cup of packed brown sugar and no white sugar at all and there was a good amount of sweetness. Also decreased the butter to 1 1/4 cups. Used regular (not a fancy brand) raspberry jam as well as some thawed, mixed frozen berries that I mashed and mixed in with the jam. Definitely keep an eye on the coconut when toasting it...I had mine on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 and it started burning at 2 minutes! When I baked the actual bars, I kept the pan covered with foil for most of the time, to make sure that the coconut in the topping didn't burn too.

Rating: 3
Here's another variation: Forget the jam! Also, per recommendations, omitted white sugar & used organic unsweetened coconut (watch out, it toasts much faster than the Angel Flake stuff). After liberally sampling the dough, pressed it into a 9" square pan instead of the 9 x 13. Result: Wonderful, chewy shortbread squares. Just sweet enough, great w/ afternoon coffee.

I used Earth Balance non-dairy margarine in place of the unsalted butter in order to make these dairy-free and vegan. They turned out great. :)

Seriously good and very easy. Used Strawberry preserves cause that's what I had and added some white chocolate chips to the top layer cause my boys think all desserts must have chocolate.

Update: I did make these again, this time kneading more carefully. The dough was still crumbly around edges, though. I did heat the jam and that made it a cinch to spread. Prettier bars this time. Still delicious. I do leave out the white sugar, as other suggest.

Rating: 3
I had a lot of trouble spreading the jam over the dough. I guess I needed to knead more. I do see that some people heated the jam to make it spread more easily. I ended up just flipping it in half since it was a crumbly mess (used parchment paper to press right side over the left. This makes for fatter bars, but saved the batch. Then I didn't need the reserved topping. A workable save-- just make sure you do really knead until dough is firm and consider warming the jam.

Amazing all together. I used blackberry and blueberry preserve. The toasted coconut added a perfect crisp

Super tasty...easy...made with pantry items so excellent for last minute dessert or a little something to bring to a party, picnic or BBQ...agree with other reviewers, extra jam is necessary

I left out the granulated sugar as suggested, and left out coconut as well, as I didn't have any on hand. I threw in some fresh blueberries with the jam, which frankly, was a no-name supermarket variety. They were gone in minutes, and I had multiple requests for the recipe. Delicious and so easy!

These are amazing. Must use good jam, like Bonne Maman. So nice to have a treat that you can generally whip up with what's already in your kitchen.

This is truly excellent. The risk is eating too many of them. I do double the raspberry jam (as others have recommended) and up the amount of coconut a bit.

The first time I made these, I followed the recipe and the bars were wonderful. Today, I tried to make them a little healthier. Used 3/4 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 all purpose flour, 1/4 almond meal and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal. Also substituted unrefined whole can sugar for the brown sugar. Due to the extra 1/2 cup of dry ingredients, I added 1 tablespoon of milk at the end (I mixed all in the food processor - didn't bother to fold anything in - EASY!). I was pleasantly surprised at how well the bars did with all of these substitutions. They are delicious! Next time I'll see if I can completely get rid of the white flour...

I wish that we could rate this as a 3.5 fork recipe. This was very easy. I also left out the granulated sugar and the bars were plenty sweet enough.

painfully, jaw achingly sweet, even after dropping the white sugar & using sugar free jam. Love the idea but couldn't eat even one.

Rating: 4
very easy to make and can easily substitute/add ingredients to your liking. i used the jelly i had on hand, a combination of ligonberry and blueberry, opted no to add the 1/4cup of granulated sugar since the jelly is sweet, and added sliced almonds on top. it was delicious- super fast and super easy and was the right amount of sweet. great dessert to make when you're in a pinch.

Rating: 4
Took others advise and skipped the granulated sugar. Used 8 oz homemade raspberry preserves (w/seeds) and added about 1/2 cup toasted pecans to the crumble (needed to use it up). Baked in a pyrex 9x13 at 350 for 30 minutes and it came out perfect. Rave reviews. Will make again without hesitation and will try other flavors.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made the following changes: omitted the granulated sugar per other reviewers, omitted the top layer of coconut (my kids don't like to "see" it), and after blending in the butter, I added the toasted coconut and oatmeal to the food processor instead of folding in. Also, I ran out of old fashioned oats so used a combo of old fashioned and quick. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
I thought these were great! Based on other reviews, I did leave out the granulated sugar, and I only had raspberry preserves (with seeds) so used those. I don't think the seeds made any negative impact on the dish. My coconut did not burn as some others did - I baked them in a 9x13 metal pan and lined with parchment paper so it would be eay to lift out. I know some have complained that these are too sweet, and I don't particularely enjoy overly sweet things, but I thought these were great, nice meld of flavors. I might try it with apricots sometime, that does sound good, too. Oh, and these were really pretty easy.

Rating: 3
these bars include many of my favorite flavors...coconut, raspberry, oatmeal...I don't love overly-sweet sweets so I took other reviewers' advice and omitted the white sugar and used unsweetened coconut(found at local natural foods coop). Even with these ommissions they were still a bit too sweet but stillgood. I added a bit of wheat germ to the crust as per another reviewer, I think these would be good with almonds or almond meal added to the crust... Almonds are often paired with coconut and raspberries. The crust came out like a short bread. I nuked the jam to make it easier to spread. I used supermarket brand of jam, and it really has made the bars way too sweet. Next time I'll try a low sugar or a homemade jam. I also covered the top with tin foil at the end to stop the coconut from burning. All in all, if you like these flavors, these are a must... a great receipe to tweak to your own personal sweetness liking.

I love this recipe. I've made it 4 or 5 times this month alone - its a big hit! I use Bittersweet Herb Farms Raspberry jam - it is the best, not too sweet. They do mail order too!

Thanks for the suggestions to cut out the white sugar and to watch the coconut carefully when browning at the beginning. I did both these things and am glad I did. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. The bars came out tasting delicious, and they look just like the picture. So easy to make. Very rich butter flavor. Like the idea of adding some fresh or frozen raspberries to the middle ... maybe next time.

Rating: 4
6oz raspberry preserves did not seem like enough to me. I put 1/2 package of frozen raspberries over the preserves. Used a light-colored pan and had to bake an additional 10 minutes to ensure that the middle crust was not soggy. With those modifications, these bars were exceptional. Very rich. Next time I might cut back on the butter in the crust a little...

What a great combo of flavors!

I have been making this since it first appeared to rave reviews. The jam doesn't need to be seedless, a few fresh raspberries really help the flavor and a sprinkling of semi-sweet or dark and white chocolate chips on top of the jam put these over the top.

These bars are delicious, I made them for a church event and everyone loved them. I did make a couple of changes, I did not add coconut, instead I added toasted almonds. I also omitted the extra sugar. I will make these again and again

Rating: 4
This was very good! I didn't add the white sugar, and I used unsweetened coconut. Also, I lined the pan with parchment - leaving flaps - to make the bars easier to lift out. The other change was that I smashed up some fresh raspberries with the jam. I used a 9X9 pan, and I'm not sure the dough would have stretched to a pan larger then that. For the coconut topping, I put it on just five minutes before the bars were done so that it didn't burn. They turned out very well, and I will be making them again soon. They would be good with any flavor filling.

I am amused by the CO/NY exchange, being from both places. It's a lot easier to be nice when you're living in the former, though. Since NYC has a point about the ratings, I am rating this recipe as-is ... phenomenal. But for those more laid-back western types who aren't adverse to emendations, I made these as protein bars: 1.25 C unflavored soy protein powder; 3/4 C wheat flour; 1/2 C brn sugar; 3/4 butter and 1.5 C oats as stated; 1 C ground walnuts; 2 C low-sugar jam. Coconut optional. Delicious -- enjoy.

This is a great recipe. I didn't use the coconut though. Less is more in my opinion. I also added cinnamon to the flour mixture. You can use almost any filling for this. I made it with raspberry perserves and then apricot preserves. Both were wonderful.

mmm...my boyfriend's father RAVED about these tonight! i definitely followed the advice of others before me: don't use the granulated sugar.. and if you werent lucky enough to have a mixer and used your hands like me, the dough that you pressed against the bottom of the pan may not be so firm when you try to spread the jam or preserves.. i used strawberry and raspberry on batches i had to split cause i didnt have one 9 x 13, but i had an 8" pie pan and an 8 x 8 smaller pan... i ended up microwaving the preserves so it was super easy to spread and was an even layer. anyway.. they're delicious! Definite repeater.

Hello ~ Just made this recipe and the only variariation that I made, was that I used seedless strawberry jam instead of raspberry, not just 3/4 cupr but an entire 12 oz jar ~ they turned out great !

Rating: 3
Really yummy with the recommendations in other reviews to cut down the sugar. I eliminated the white sugar and used 2/3 unsweetened coconut and 1/3 sweetened. My coconut browned faster than 8 minutes (maybe 6 1/2?), so watch that carefully. Next time, I will use all unsweetened coconut and try a low sugar raspberry jam. Also, did not "lift out in 1 piece" - seemed impossible! I made a narrow cut around the perimeter of the pan since the jam stuck to the sides, then cut the squares right in the pan.

Excellent, would have given 4 forks but they were a little too sweet. I used 1/2 cup light brown sugar and half sweetened and half unsweetened coconut. Defintely will make again with all unsweetened coconut and omit the white sugar.

Yuck. Im in the camp of people who think this cookie is painfully sweet. I would not make the recipe again as written. I like the idea of it though, and plan to try again adopting the suggestions of previous reviewers (decreasing the sugar, using unsweetened coconut, perhaps some nut meal in the base). I was able to cover the entire area of the pan using the ¾ c. of preserves called for, but I think more would be better, and would increase the preserves to 1 cup.

Rating: 3
I took the advice of some other reviewers and decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, also used approx one cup of jam. Used a metal pan greased with Crisco. Cooled bars completely, loosened the edges, cut in half and lifted each half out with ease. Plan to make again tomorrow.

HI, from Omaha. I was actually asked by two women from our Church group for this recipe. The bars had to be good if Church ladies are asking for the recipe. Those gals know every good recipe in the book. When I made them I did not have foil to line the pan so I used wax paper to line the bottom of the pan. Unfortunately that was not a good idea. I spent a lot of time peeling and scraping the wax paper off the bottom of the bars. Next time I will use the foil as suggested. And I did decrease the sugar a little.

Rating: 3
Personally, I do not a very sweet tooth, but I'd made it for my sister after she'd had her 5th baby, and she LOVED it!!! She asked me to make it for the babys' christening a week later. I also made it for my sister-in-law after her baby, and she called me not even a week later asking for the recipe. Once, I did not have enough coconut for the topping, so after the bars were cooling off, I made a simple glaze and drizzled it over and my husband could not stop taking seconds and thirds!

After modifications (omit white sugar, extra jam to cover dough), this came out too sweet to my taste: good, but I think next time I'll reduce the brown sugar, swap 1/4 of flour for finely ground nuts, and try all-fruit preserves, perhaps mixed with fresh raspberry and/or a tablespoon of lemon juice. Covering the pan with foil for half the baking time kept the coconut from browning too fast.

Rating: 3
Making it now, but wonder: if the coconut burns after 7 minutes when I try to toast it, how can the whole pan of bars bake for 20 minutes without the coconut being reduced to cinders? I am baking it covered in foil and will see what happens. Like others, I left out the white sugar, and melted the jam on the stove first. I used more than 3/4 of a cup of jam.

Rating: 4
Wow! The previous reviewer was right about these bars being addictive; my family couldn't stop eating them straight from the pan! They are so delicious. I took other reviewers' advice and omitted the white sugar and changed to sweetened coconut, and it came out yummy. At 10 minutes into cooking time, I peeped in the oven and noticed the coconut browning quickly, so I covered with foil for remainder 15 minutes and was glad I did. These will become a staple of my baking repertoire.

These were super easy and really delicious--may be a bit rich; next time I will take another reviewer's advice and use 1 stick of butter and try 2 Tbsp. of apple juice concentrate, and maybe cut back on the sugar a little.

I've made these many times, and it's always a hit. Considering how easy they are and how good they taste, I'd say that merit four forks. I tried these once with blueberry jam and wasn't wowed. There's just something about raspberry with coconut...

I plan to serve these to my sisters who are coming to town, along with Ginger Margaritas (sadly - the recipe did not make it onto the website, only the print version of Bon Appetit) and the Grilled Tuna Salade Nicoise from this site. I will definitely make these again - I had to hide them so my boyfriend would not find them before the sisters arrived.

To the people jumping on the cook from NYC: The criticism was directed at someone who changed the recipe so much that it was completely different from the original. That is not the same as saying "I cut the sugar in half" or "this could use more garlic" or "I used rosemary instead of thyme". Changes like this do not really make it a drastically different recipe, but the changes from the allergy-sufferer did, which makes that review a bit irrelevant for people looking to specifically make oatmeal coconut raspeberry bars. That's all NYC was saying.

I don't see why people are saying the cook from NY was mean. She was making a general statement, about when you change the recipe, you aren't reviewing the given recipe, you are reviewing your own version! Right? I think you guys are the ones who need to lighten up; you are attacking her! Anyway, I made the recipe exactly as written, and that's what I am reviewing. I did not like the coconut with oatmeal, so I may play around with it some if I make it again, and not use the oatmeal, or not use the coconut, I'll have to see. But there would be many different versions of this basic recipe to experiment with; but I won't be reviewing my own version, I believe too, that these recipes are meant to try as written, or don't make it and try a different recipe if you are allergic.

The review is supposed to be a "review" of the "given" recipe, NOT a totally changed version of it,duh. Sorry, I had to make this statement, for it is so stupid and annoying when this is done. This recipe, as it is written, is great! Would not change a thing; if I did change it, it would NOT BE THIS recipe, now would it?

Very, very yummy, but very sweet. I wonder if there is any way to cut down on the sugar? would preserves be better? would it work just to not add so much sugar, or would that screw up the recipe? Any suggestions? I also had to use one egg in the dough mixture to keep it stuck together.

Due to some allergies, I can't eat commercial energy bars and am on a quest to find a reasonable, homemade substitute. This one's still more of a cookie than a health food (but most of the others are too!). Since coconut is out, I used an extra cup of oats which I toasted, and half wheat/half white flour. I used 1 stick of butter and 2 Tb thawed apple juice concentrate intead of 1.5 sticks (a trick from the Canyon Ranch cookbook). Went a little easy on the brown sugar b/c of the concentrate as well. Used black cherry fruit spread (I hate raspberry) and crossed my fingers. They are delish!! Rich, chewy, and a tad more healthful than the original. Can't wait to try a blueberry version.

What a delicious treat these turned out to be. So easy to put together with wonderful tastes coming through. Next time I would consider putting some chopped nuts into the base for a little more texture.

I think it is better to use unsweetened coconut. It doesn't take away much sweetness, and the sweetened stuff tends to brown too quickly. I also used frozen raspberries in place of the jam, I think they look and taste better.

I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry, since it was all I had on hand, and it worked well. I have never made a dough in a food processor before, and it looked too dry and crumbly. After feeling the dough, I realized it would come together fine when pressed in a pan. Press it in tight in order to spread the jam easily across the top. I also reduced the amount of brown sugar to 1/2 cup, which was plenty sweet. The full 3/4 cups would have been overkill.

Rating: 0
I made these 3 weeks in a row because they kept disappearing. I like mine with a bit more salt to give cut the sweetness. Make sure you get the crust pushed up the side of the pan a little because the raspberry turns to glue if it touches your pan. To avoid this, I also use a glass pan lined with parchment for easier removal.

I would really give these 3 and a half stars if I could. They are very yummy. The addition of coconut really adds to the flavor of these bars.

I would certainly make it again.

This is so simple and nearly impossible to mess up. I used Polaner All Fruit (not super-sweet), didn't do the coconut on top, and only 1/2 c of brown sugar. They came out perfect! I can't wait to serve them to my in-laws tomorrow. If I have any left ;)

This is the absolute best bar cookie I have ever tasted. I made a few changes: decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, used regular butter & eliminated the salt (didn't have any unsalted butter on hand) and added 3/4 cup toasted, chopped walnuts to the crust. Left out the coconut. Lined the metal pan with parchment paper. Was a breeze to remove from the pan. Baked a little longer until golden.

This is a quick recipe that yields terrific results. I have made it several times. If you don't like coconut, try chopped, unsalted, toasted macadamia nuts (Trader Joe's sells them already roasted and chopped). I used 1 cup of nuts and increased the oatmeal to 2 cups. I mixed all the nuts into the dough, raher than sprinkling some on top. Also, high quality cherry jam also works.

Then when done, I just pull the whole "bar" out of the pan and slice with a pizza cutter once cooled. I also like high-quality Strawberry Rhubarb perserves even better than the raspberry.

mine totally fell apart -- I did use a glass pan rather than a metal one, maybe that's what happened. Delicious when eaten with ice cream with a spoon but don't expect to be able to carry "bars" with you, mine were more like a fistful of oatmeal!

Nice and chewy. Reminds me of granola bar. It doesn't have that initial "wow" feeling, but it kinda grows on you. I only used 1/2 cup brown and 1/8 cup granulated sugar, and that turned out the perfect sweetness for me. My husband who doesn't like shredded coconut wasn't bothered by it. This is a nice & easy recipe for spur-of-the-moment sweets craving. If you like raspberry, try hazelnut raspberry brownies from this site.

This is a great recipe! I am currently printing it out for some friends who tried them and wanted to know how to make them. They are about as easy as making something from a mix and they come out really good. I wouldn't change a thing! They are great with a scoop of ice cream!

Oh-so-good! I made the bars for my fiance's surprise 40th birthday party, and they were so good-- believe it or not-- before he even arrived at the party, (he WAS the last one to come in, naturally) they were all gone. He was so jealous about everyone raving about them and him missing his chance to try one, that he made me make him a pan the next week, just for him. I guess they were a success!

I loved these! I substituted blueberry preserves, and my husband thought they were a bit sweet. Didn't bother my guests, who snatched them up off a buffet table. Can't wait to experiment with other jams -- maybe something more tart?

These bars are so easy and versatile. I used my new kitchen aid mixer to do all the work. Watch out, I nearly burned the coconut when toasting it. It asks for a 375 degree oven and toast for 8 minutes. Yikes! Watch it very carefully. I revamped the recipe and used 1/2 salted butter 1/2 unsalted, and dark brown sugar because I didn't have any light. You could use any jam or preserves you want. They are rich, crumbly, and taste healthy with the oats. Will make again and again!!!!

These are great for a dessert-table contribution and everyone seems to love them. My advice after making them three times: use a good-quality seedless jam and not too much. Watch you toast the coconut, we scorched a couple of batches.

This was good, but I must have messed up because the bars were too crumbly. Okay, I admit I didn't use REAL butter either, so they were a bit salty, should have eliminated the salt it calls for. Also, don't skimp on the seedless jam unless you want all of those little seeds stuck in your teeth.

So much raspberry jam made the bars too tangy and tart, but the next day, those flavors had mellowed. Make this a day ahead, and the flavors will have balanced. Good recipe.

These bars were not only fantastically quick & easy to make, they also tasted divine. I left the coconut topping off until the last 5-10 minutes of cooking, so as not to burn it, and thought this adaptation worked nicely. I also found the bars needed slightly less cooking time than noted in the recipe. In the end, everyone enjoyed these delicious summery treats.

Great recipe. I used seeded raspberry preserves which were very sweet. Next time I'll either use a less sweet preserve or reduce the sugar slightly as I thought these were a little too sweet.

This was so easy and taste oh so good! For those foodies that thought this recipe was painfully sweet, try unsweetend coconut and . Trader Joe's carries bags of unsweetened coconut for half the price you would pay in the local supermarket. I also used a mix of seeded blackberry and raspberry perserves and found the tart sweetness balanced very well with the other ingredients. I have made this many times since discovering the recipe a few weeks ago.

I cut down on the sugar when I made these, as suggested by a number of reviewers. I also covered the pan with foil about halfway through cooking, as the coconut was turning too dark for my taste. Got rave reviews from everyone who tried them!

I agree that the quality of the jam may have a big part to do with the taste. The bar part was terrific - even before cooking - but I used Smuckers jam, and even for me, they were too sweet.

Very, very good bar cookie. Based on previous reviews, reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup--perfect. Used seedless black raspberry jam which was a little tart and also helped tone down the sweetnes. I just pulsed in the oats and coconut in the food processor and it worked fine.I think the success (and sweetness)of this cookie depends a lot on the type and quality of jam used.

Very good. Added more jam, as the called-for amount left about 2T. left in the jar, thought the extra couldn't hurt. No other changes, and turned out quite well.

I used unsweetened coconut and several different kinds of berry jam (I was cleaning out my fridge)and it was delicious. I also used half butter/half canola oil and changed the proportions of brown sugar and white sugar and the result was still terrific. Everyone from toddlers to seniors ate them up!

Yum!!! I made these for a graduation party a long with two other types of bars and these were gone the fastest- adults and kids both love them! They were sweet and crunchy and the combination of brown sugar, coconut, oatmeal, and jam was to die for! I'll deffianlty be making this recipe again!

This recipe is a dream. It uses the the food processor, no exotic ingrediants, (Pantry Items), and my family and friends raved over them. I did watch the coconut toast time, and have used other preserves such as apricot, pineapple, blackberry, and cherry. They freeze well too. Unfortunatley my family thought the frozen cookies tasted good to. I now freeze all cookies in opaque containers marked brussel sprouts and lima beans. That works like a charm! I also hide goddies in the vegetable drawer of the fridge. These will be great to add for the Christmas cookies plate.

SO YUMMY! I made these last night EXACTLY as the recipe read and they are DELICIOUS! As one reader said; sweet but addictive. What more do you want in a bar cookie anyway? If you want health food snack, look elsewhere for gosh sakes! To prevent too crumbly a dough, follow directions exactly! Let a dough form while still in the food processor. It will suddenly thicken up and start to be a dough rolling around. I added BAKER'S coconut (toasted 4 min. BTW) and oatmeal right in the processor and mixed it in with short pulses. Press FIRMLY in the pan and reserve 3/4 cup, firmly packed for the topping. I used Knott's Berry Farm Jam 10 oz. jar, warmed and stirred. I am always amazed as why people wonder why the recipe didn't come out right... Try following the directions! Don't experiment the first time!

Rating: 4
I've made these with apricot, lemon, peach and raspberry jam. I get so many compliments! Finally. One tip, press the crust into the cookie tray and then pop it into the oven. The heat will allow the jam to spread on smoother.

I loved this recipe. I felt like I was at Starbuck's while eating these bars and drinking a cup of coffee. I displayed the bars on a clear glass cake stand with a clear glass lid like they have at gourmet coffee shops and bakeries on my kitchen counter. My family and friends loved this. I am from Louisisana, and this summer I am going to make them with strawberry jam made from Louisiana strawberries.

I used whole wheat flour instead of white, and they turned out great. Also, reduced the amount of brown sugar. I think you could also get away with reducing the amount of jam. Overall, a great dessert!

I told my anti-coconut family that these were Oatmeal-Raspberry Bars and they didn't say a word. They were too busy eating the bars! I made some for a family get together but had to make them a second time since the first batch disappeared in 24 hours. I think I will try these with other flavor jams as well. I did cut the sugar by 1/3 on the second batch and did not notice a difference. As said before - watch that toasting coconut as soon as it hits 4 minutes. After 4, it toasts at warp speed!

Made these after work last night. Easy and delicious. Perhaps even better today with my morning coffee! The other reviewers who mentioned 4 minutes as being enough for toasting the coconut are absolutely right. You have to watch it like a hawk. I used unsweetened coconut from the Baker's Catalog as it was all I had. Next time, I may use sweetened coconut for the part you toast. Its moister and plumper and I think it may help the bars hold together better. Cutting them into clean slices did take a little care. I didn't reduce the sugar and didn't feel that they were too sweet. I used Dickinson's seedless Red Raspberry preserves, which spread perfectly (without heating) after a vigorous stir. If you have trouble patting the dough into the pan, cover your hand with a piece of cling-film and 'pat' through that. Can't wait to make these again for our beach picnics. A nice change of pace from the good old brownie.

Rating: 4
Let it be known that I am not a coconut fan, but boy were these gooooood - good enough that before they were completely cool they were already out and being tasted with several people requesting the recipe. Based on the responses from other reviewers about the sweetness, I used unsweetened shredded coconut, reduced the brown sugar by 1/4 cup and used an all-fruit unsweetened seedless raspberry spread. I also cover the bars with foil, removing it during the last three minutes of baking to keep the coconut on top from burning. And definately watch the coconut while you are toasting! 3-4 minutes at 345 degrees was plenty; any longer and it started smoking!

I've made these six times since February's Gourmet and only now got the chance to check the reviews. Needless to say, I'm rather flabbergasted that some people didn't like these-- they are almost too delicious! Everytime I serve to guests, I have them practically swooning. Try these bars!

This recipe is soooo sweet. If you have a REAL sweet-tooth it may still be a little too sweet for you. I actually wonder if there's an error in the recipe. Could they have meant unsweetened coconut rather than sweetened?

Rating: 1
I also found these bars achingly sweet and that was using unsweetened, shredded coconut because I've never seen the sweetened, flaked variety over here. I was able to find seedless raspberry jam but perhaps instead of regular jam one should use the all fruit no added sugar variety you find in the health food section of the supermarket.

Rating: 3
These were decadent.. Healthy? In whose world? I used bits and pieces of leftover homemade jam (blackberry, strawberry and quince). Next time I will use more jam since the bars were pretty flat. To the reviewer from Long Island - the recipe says to reserve 3/4 CUP of dough, not 3/4 of all of the dough . And yes, the coconut takes at the most 4 minutes to toast. I used a little less sugar than was called for and added a little lemon juice to the warmed up jam to make it a little tangy - wonderful. If you don't like coconut, skip this recipe. Quick oats work fine instead of old-fashioned, too. I mixed sweetened with unsweetened coconut to cut down on the sweetness....

Rating: 4
Easy, delicious and healthy (relatively...!!). I added wheat germ to the oatmeal mix and the kids couldn't tell. I made it in a smaller pan to the bars were higher which made a huge difference. It's a winner!!

Quick and easy recipe to make but I don't think I will make with raspberry jam again. I'll try an apricot jam next time.

I just tasted my first batch of these cookies. They are a dream, especially if you like Raspberry Jam, and coconut. But that coconut! When toasting it, stand by the oven. Stir it frequently, not just once. AND BY ALL MEANS, do not cook it beyond the golden brown stage or you'll have a smoky house... Also, I think the instructions might have been incorrect. They say to reserve three quarters of the dough, and press the remainder into the pan, but I think it would make a thicker cookie if you spread HALF to three quarters of the dough in the bottom and put the lesser amount on top with the white coconut.

This was very simple but way too sweet! If I were to make it again, I would cut down on the sugar. Folks liked it, but most thought that it had too much sugar.

The only change I made in the recipe was to not toast the coconut. For all the people who didn't like the recipe, I wonder if they used a GOOD raspberry jam? I used homemade raspberry freezer jam which I think has a superior fresh taste. Since the jam is one of the major ingredients, it has to be a GOOD jam. Also, real butter. The entire family loved this recipe. I am saving it for the future. Would be good for picnics. I think it will be especially good for using up homemade jam that didn't set well. I never know what to do with it.

Good and easy.I thought a bit sweet, but noone else did. Dough is sticky to press in pan.Used a whole jar of hero and stirred it well so it was easy to spread. Use less crust on bottom.Also took longer to cook @ 30-33min. Top was "raw/doughy" at 25 min.

I'm not giving a number because I altered the recipe (I subbed 1/4 cup ground flaxseed for flour, and added an additional 1/4 cup wheat germ. I also added sliced almonds to the dough. I'm always looking to sneak fiber into good stuff!) I would, however, give them a 3 for delicious. I used organic raspberry fruit spread, and had no problems spreading. I too, thought it wasn't enough jam when I put it on, but once baked, it's fine. Everyone loves them, and my 10 year old begged me to put them in his lunchbox. Definitely a repeat, though I'll probably use plain coconut, as it would cut the sugar, and I don't think the bars would suffer. They are quite sweet.

Rating: 4
These are fabulous. My husband, who does not generally like coconut, devoured them. Great with coffee! I also warmed the jam (in the microwave on half power) for easier spreading. I used Knott's seedless. Also, watch when toasting the coconut--4 minutes at the most. For those having trouble with the bars crumbling, press the dough firmly in the pan and gently press the topping and coconut into the jam before baking.

Rating: 4
My family really like these bars. I made them in a smaller pan (8x12) so that they would be thicker like the bars at a local bakery. Might try 9x9 next time. I also accidentally used 1 cup of raspberry-gooseberry jam that I made last summer. It was a good mistake! I held out 1 cup of dough for the topping and I didn't bother kneading the oats and coconut in, just pulsed it in at the end.

These are to die for. Not sure what the previous reviewer's problem could have been. I've made these three times, and each batch has been as good as everyone says.

I made these for my husband to bring into work and everyone loved them. I took the advice of another reviewer and warmed the jam slightly in a saucepan before spreading it and it worked perfectly. I only had the grocery store brand raspberry jam (with seeds) on hand and people still thought they were excellent

Rating: 3
Wow! These are great! I always seem to gravitate toward chocolate desserts, but since I had all the ingredients in my kitchen, I thought I would give them a try. They are simply delcious! On half the pan, I pressed chopped macadamia nuts in the crust to see what that would taste like. I thought both sides were great, but my husband preferred the bars with nuts. As a side note, I used Knott's Farm jam--very nice!

I made these in a foil-lined pan, which I buttered. (Much easier to get them out this way.) My family loved them, while I thought they were pretty good. Maybe the jam I used wasn't fine enough quality - I thought the filling tasted only okay...

Lovely bars. My modifications include: watch that coconut like a hawk (eight min. in oven waaaaay too long-- more like four), used raspberry -blackberry jam (with - gasp! - seeds and all), and butter the pan meticulously. I didn't bother trying to get it out of the pan all in one piece. It seemed silly. Make sure your pan is metal, not glass. These truly are wonderful. Have fun; it will take lots of self-control not to eat the entire thing yourself.

Thanks to the suggestion below, I didn't bother to seek out seedless raspberry jam or old-fashioned oats (just used regular rasp jam and quick cooking oats) and these were sooooo tasty.

I needed a quick and easy dessert without going out to shop so I chose this one out of the most recent issue of Gourmet. A hit with everyone - I took the leftovers to work and they disappeared in a jif. This is so quick, easy and delicious you won't believe it. Two things: toast your coconut at a lower over temp or watch it like a hawk, also, I used Bonne Maman Wild Berry jam instead because that's what was in the house - I think this jam may have been even better than the recommended raspberry. It's not seedless but that didn't seem to matter. A definite addition to my dessert arsenal.
