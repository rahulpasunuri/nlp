I love this cake! It isn't too sweet or rich, and is perfect with a little whip cream and strawberries or as is. I always toss some of the dried coconut flakes on top right when it comes out of the oven and it looks lovely.

We loved this cake. It is an easy, moist and delicious coconut pound cake. I served it with mango and strawberries. As others indicated (I'm glad I read the reviews first), the cake takes about 1 hour and 10 minutes to bake.

I would have given it 4 forks, but the timing was completely off for me. I used a 9" springform, so I was surprised when poking the cake at exactly 45 minutes showed that it was comletely clean (it even looked a little dry). I would have expected it to take longer than usual given the smaller pan size. I took the cake out, cooled it on a rack for a while, and when it was reasonably cool, decided to try a piece. Everything was fine until I got close to the center. There were about 2 cups of batter that hadn't yet cooked. Since the top had already formed a nice crust, this probably "wiped off" my tester when I pulled it out, so it appeared to be done. I just threw it back in the oven (an oven which, it should be noted, has a spot on temperature). Just be careful when you cook it, but yes, it is delicious (and wonderfully moist).

I used this as a base for a birthday cake, taking inspiration from a number of different recipes on epicurious. Anyone who has ever read Steve Almonds Candy Freak, putting dried coconut in anything loses it some of its luster, so I just couldnt bear to use any in this batter that was so smooth and creamy looking. I swapped out 6 oz light coconut milk and 2 oz skim milk for the whole milk. I baked the recipe in two 8-in rounds for 40 minutes, then filled the layers with homemade peach compote, and frosted with 7-minute icing in which I replaced the vanilla extract with coconut extract. Finally, I coated the sides of the frosted cake with toasted coconut and strew fresh blueberries on top, and served with homemade peach ice cream. Delicious! The cake is dense, but very moist, not at all dry or crumbly  made an excellent layer cake but would also be delicious plain, or with glaze, or with compote.

I usually don't like non-frosted cakes, butI had some unsweetened coconut to get rid of, so I thought I would try this. It was great! All loved it. Great rich buttery-coconutty flavour. I made a mango reduction sauce for on top, but I can imagine tasting even better with a thick chocolate sauce.

Very, very good, but in the over for 90 minutes before it set! Next time I'll use two pans for a layer cake with fruit filling and topping.

This is a wonderful, dense cake, but the baking time is way off. It has always taken a lot longer than the recipe says it will...and then the top gets too brown. I'm going to get a bigger pan for next time

Excellent! I made this as a loaf cake, and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I toasted the coconut and sub'd 1/2 c evaporated milk and 1/2 c ff milk. Greased the loaf pan with leftover shortening and did not use any paper lining. Cake came out perfectly. Baking time stated in the recipe seems off - my actual baking time (gas oven, nothing quirky about it) was 1 and 1/2 hours. Rises and browns/crisps very nicely, but note that this cake has a very crumby texture. Ice cream complemented the cake perfectly!

Delicious! Not too sweet, very moist. I have made this many times and always get lots of complements.

Made this cake before and it was OK but this time I substituted the coconut milk for milk like the previous reviewers. It came out very well - our company loved it. It does need a sauce so I made a berry coulis to brighten the plate.

I made this cake and served it with the Lemon-Lime Dessert Sauce from Bon Appetit April 1999. My Grandmother has been begging me to make her a coconut and lemon cake for five years. This was my first time baking anything from scratch, but this combo was easy and tasted fabulous! I will be making this for New Year's and I had to promise to make it for her again next year!

I bake this cake all the time, although I toast the coconut & substitute coconut milk for the whole milk which gives it even more coconut flavor.

I made this recipe yesterday and loved it as a pound cake. Had I expected a regular cake I might have felt differently. It took about 15 minutes longer to bake than the recipe called for, but otherwise I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I served it with strawberry sauce from Bon Appetit, June 1998, and it got rave reviews. I will definitely make it again.

I love this cake. I increased the salt to 1 tsp and added a generous amount of milk-chocolate chips. Moist, rich and delicious.

I think the overall poor rating for this cake is due to the fact that people anticipate a light, fluffy cake, when it it more like a pound cake. It has a delightful, lightly sweet coconut flavor. I often have one stashed away in my freezer which I can haul out last minute. Since it is not cloyingly sweet, it is the perfect foil for a sweet sauce and I usually make an espresso-chocolate or ginger-nectarine sauce. Yum.

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE coconut and was so excited to find this recipe. It was a huge disappointment. It was very heavy. I don't like heavy cakes. I like light and fluffy. I'd rather make a cake mix white cake and top with white frosting and coconut.

There was nothing special about this cake. It in no way compares with my all-time favorite coconut cake. Too dry and very dense. On the plus side, it is very easy to make.

I made it for my husband's birthday and he loved it. I could not find unsweetened coconut in the supermarket so bought the sweetened kind. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup instead of 1 1/3 cup to comepensate for the coconut's sweeteness.

my husband really likes this cake and he is not a coconut cake fan...i love this cake - it's not overly sweet and easy. i usually make a tropical fruit sorbet to serve with it. it is now my favorite cake. the only change i have made is to use baker's suger instead of regular

I couldn't believe I didn't love this cake after all the rave reviews. It was, as the fork says, just so-so. I can't imagine you'd want to do without a topping of some kind. I did another search for a white chocolate espresso sauce..served it with that, sliced and peeled kiwi and espresso beans for garnish. Presented well and was a nice change for a grown-up birthday cake, but it's not a keeper.

It's a wonderful cake. And it's so easy to make. I served it with sliced fresh peaches and homemade whipped cream - like a strawberry shortcake. the next day, i ate it with mango sorbet. it's truly delicious, and simple to make.

I made this cake several times. This is a big hit every time I make it. It is a stand alone cake, but I serve it with a berry sauce for color

This is just an absolutely wonderful, simple cake. No need to frost, no need to do anything. The flavor is great, the texture light, it's just perfect.

I bake all the time & this is one of the best cakes I've ever made. I've made it 3 times now & it turned out moist, buttery and delicious every time. Highly recommended & simple to make!

This is truly a wonderful cake!! It has a lot of moisture with a buttery taste that really doesn't need a frosting. Thank you so much!! Liz Collyard - Dallas, Tx

I haven't made this cake yet, but in answer to the questions about dessicated coconut. Dessicated means dried. Here in Europe, I can only find that type (which is not anything like sweetened, flaked coconut). I have to bring that back from the U.S. when I am visiting. Probably a specialty food shop or Asian shop would have the dessicated.

I made this exactly from the article, I even used mango and blueberries on the top. The cake was moist by itself, and does not necessarily need a topping. And it was even better the next day. Can't wait to make it again!

I baked this in an 8 inch square pan and made a lime glaze. (1/3 cup sugar melted into 5 tbs. lime juice). I poked holes in the warm cake and drizzled. It tasted great. The inside was moist and the crust was like a gateau basque. Served with soft whipped cream and tropical fruit. Cake was even better the following day.

This is very similar to a pound cake that contains coconut. I topped the cake with fresh raspberries and a pureed raspberry glaze. The cake DEFINITELY needs a topping. With so many other great dessert recipes, I would not make this average recipe again.

I made this cake to serve at a brunch. I didn't know what dessicated coconut was either, but I found out that it's the same as shredded. I used shredded coconut from a package (it wasn't unsweetened as the recipe suggested). The cake was absolutely marvelous. Very moist and very delicious. I added an almond glaze and topped the cake with toasted coconut. YUMMMMY!!! The almond glaze added a wonderful bonus!

My husband simply adores coconut cake. I would love to make this one for him, but could someone tell me what is desiccated coconut?

This cake is wonderful! I have made it several times and have used both fresh and packaged coconut and it turns out great. I serve it like a shortcake with toppings of strawberries and/or peaches, and whipped cream. Yum!

I thought this recipe was very straightforward and the cake turned out delicious, moist, slightly dense, and full of character, and it got raving reviews from guests. I used a store-bought chocolate frosting to decorate it, since I love the coconut-chocolate combination.

This cake turned out well. I topped it with fresh blueberries and peaches. I will try the chocolate espresso sauce, if the recipe is available.
