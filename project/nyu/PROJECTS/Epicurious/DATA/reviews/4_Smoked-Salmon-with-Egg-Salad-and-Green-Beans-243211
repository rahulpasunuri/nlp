Made this in the brilliant jars as part of a picnic for an outdoor concert. Delicious and pretty.

This is my favorite go-to picnic salad. I've made it a zillion times. It's amazingly good on a sandwich without the green beans too. I use a bit less mayo, and remove a few of the egg yolks from the egg salad. Tomorrow when I make it I'll use spinach since I forgot to get arugula. Otherwise, don't change a thing. delicious!

This is a good salad idea. I used a smoked salmon which was a bit overpowering, might try a milder salmon next time. I loved the green beans and will serve them that way again all by themselves. I also thought the egg salad was a bit much. I think next time I will just use chopped hard boiled eggs and see how that goes. Maybe I'll make extra sauce for the beans as a dressing.

The only changes to this recipe I've made include flaking smoked salmon fillet (instead of starting with sliced) and using a grapeseed oil based mayo. I've made it countless times for countless occasions. When I package it for a picnic or for a quick packed dinner for my traveling husband, I reverse the order in the container. That way the arugala isn't getting squashed or soaked and it lands first on the plate or bowl when you invert the container (followed by the eggs, green beans and then salmon). So yummy!

The only deviation from the recipe that I made was to substitute greek yoghurt for the mayo, and I thought this was a delicious and light lunch. Pretty easy, too. The only cooking is the hard boiled eggs, and I threw the haricots vert in with the eggs the last two minutes of cooking to blanch. I've eaten this for lunch the past 3 days!

I prepared this recipe last August and served it 'al fresco'. I substituted fresh Lake Michigan smoked salmon and assembled it on individual glass dinner plates. It was a big hit and absolutely delicious! I will also make the "jar" version of this recipe for our boat outings.
