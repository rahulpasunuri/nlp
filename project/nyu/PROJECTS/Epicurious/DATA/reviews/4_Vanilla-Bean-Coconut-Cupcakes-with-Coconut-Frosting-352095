I made these for Easter dessert and they weren't very good at all. I used the 1 1/2 t of vanilla instead of vanilla bean - perhaps the vanilla bean might have added more flavor. As they are, the cupcakes are dense and not very sweet at all. It takes an hour for the coconut milk to reduce, and it doesn't add much flavor. The icing was only average.

Rating: 4
In fairness, this review is mostly for the icing. I was in a rush, so I improvised the cupcakes by using a chocolate mix and adding the reduced coconut mix in place of the liquid. Worked out great. I also used a baker friend's trick and let them cool inside a ziploc bag to keep them moist. The icing is great - the coconut flavor is subtle but you could always add some extract for more intense flavor.

Rating: 1
As is, the frosting is WAY too sweet in my opinion, and not coconutty enough. I added an entire stick of butter, plus maybe 1/3 cup coconut oil to balance out the sweetness. DO NOT use sweetened dried coconut; I used "Let's Do Organics"-brand unsweetened coconut flakes.Having said all that, I loved the reduced coconut milk idea and will definitely use that again!

Rating: 1
Really meh, thought these were just average and given that it took an hour to reduce the coconut milk wasn't worth the prep time. If you do decide to make these, toasting the coconut flakes is important. (I mixed half sweetened, half unsweetened flakes to keep the sweetness down.) Also, the icing tasted a lot like, well, butter.

This is my go-to cupcake recipe. I am gluten intolerant, and this recipe is a great one to make with a gluten free flour mixture. While some gluten free recipes end up dry and crumbly, I think the reduced coconut milk helps keep the cupcakes moist.

I joined just to review these cupcakes. These cupcakes are delicious. I used others suggestions and whipped the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, maybe 5 minutes, and watched them in the oven to prevent overbaking. You don't want them to brown at all. I did find the icing a little too runny. Maybe cut down on the coconut milk or butter or up the amount of powdered sugar. Anyway, they are delicious. I will definately make these again.

This is now my go to recipe for vanilla frosting. The coconut flavor is ever so slight but works ever so well. I did not think that the recipe made a generous amount, it was rather basic. For 2 batches of cupcakes I need to make 3 batches of frosting. A little was left over. I also reduced the powdered sugar by about a 1/2 cup to control the sweetness, just a preference. Sorry, didn't make the cupcakes but will some day. Well done

Absolutely amazing! Had no trouble reducing the coconut milk - took me about 25 minutes. Definitely a recipe to make again and again

I have made these cupcakes twice to bring to parties, both times they were part of an assortment of 4 or 6 kinds of cupcakes. They got the highest reviews at both parties; the other cupcakes were also well liked, but these were raved about. I used vanilla extract rather than the vanilla beans. The icing keeps well in the refrigerator and makes enough for almost two full batches of cupcakes.

YUMYUMYUMYUMYUMYUMYUM! These are so good that even a lot of people who aren't fond of coconut like them. There are so many icing recipes which have cups of icing sugar and are too sweet and low on flavour. By contrast, this icing is delicious and the whole thing almost melts in your mouth. I don't find it necessary to change a thing in making them. Absolutely perfect.

Rave reviews all around. Used coconut cream instead of reducing milk.

I used the Trader Joe's vanilla cake mix and the recipe for the icing and the combination was AMAZING!! My husband's exact words: "these are gourmet cupcakes!!" Cooking notes: Since I was only using the recipe for the icing, I used one 14 oz can of reduced fat organic coconut milk and reduced it to less than 1/2 cup. I did as the previous reviewer suggested and cooked the vanilla bean straight in the coconut milk. I ended up using the entire amount of coconut milk rather than the 1/3 cup recommended and it came out fine. I used a spatula to spread the icing and then coated the whole top of the cupcake with toasted coconut flakes. The flakes really bring out the flavor in the icing so use a generous amount. Note: this is MORE than enough icing for 18 cupcakes... I think I could have made 24-30 with the amount of icing I had!

Rating: 4
This is an amazing recipe. Like other reviewers, it took almost an hour to cook down the coconut milk, but was so worth it. I also cooked the vanilla bean in the coconut milk which gave a nice flavor throughout the cupcake. Cupcakes were dense and moist (but still with a nice crumb) and frosting was delicious. Topped with unsweetened toasted, flaked coconut which was beautiful and didn't make the cupcakes too sweet. This is going to be my new go-to cupcake recipe. Can't wait to make again!

I only did the frosting (used it with a different lemon cake recipe) and it was delicious. A nice change from the usual buttercream. Perhaps I didn't reduce the coconut milk enough, but I ended up with tons left over. Next time I'll only use one can.

Rating: 4
These are so delicious-not sure why some people complained about "muffin texture" because my cupcakes were so light and fluffy. Some tips: sift the flour and then measure, it took me over an hour to get the right consistency for the reduced coconut milk, and I actually made 24 slightly smaller cupcakes rather than 18. My cupcakes also only took 18 minutes, any longer and they probably would have been tough. I think I want to try to make these in a mini muffin pan next time.

Rating: 4
These cupcakes are SOOOOOO good!!! I couldn't reduce the coconut milk to 1.5 cups in 30 min. I don't know how much I actually reduced but I still had 2 cups after tried to reduce more than 30 min. Then I put the milk in freezer to cool. The frosting turned out to be too soft to pipe. So I ended up just smearing the frosting on the each cake and sprinkle the toasted coconuts on the top.

Rating: 3
Cake recipe: Great - I don't know why some people said they turned out like muffins. I was careful while measuring and mixing (didn't pack the flour; didn't overmix) and I also made sure to take them out of the oven right before they seemed done. I think this sometimes makes the difference between moist and dry baked goods. Reducing the coconut milk was messy and took a while. Oh, well. At least it tastes like real coconut and not fake coconut flavor. I would definitely make the cupcakes again. Frosting recipe: This could use some tweaking according to a person's taste. I found the frosting to be too soft. I think there should be less butter and more sugar so the frosting would be stiffer and more stable. It's June here and this frosting does not like to get warm. It tasted great; I would just be ready to adjust the proportions somewhat.

I only made the frosting, but it was very good. The coconut milk took a lot longer to reduce than it said, but that might easily have been user error. I ended up adding 1/3 more coconut milk, and then mixing in unsweetened coconut flakes to get it back to the right consistency. It was delicious!

Rating: 0
Agree with everyone, the frosting is amazing! I added almost 1 cup of the reduced coconut milk in place of suggested 1/3 and frosting turned out fine. Silky, smooth, fluffy, perfect. Cake was another matter altogether - it either needs one more egg or more cocnut milk or butter in it. As it stands, these cakes are on the dry and doughy side. I will try it again, but might use a different recipe for the batter.

*REVIEW FOR FROSTING ONLY* Although I did not make the cupcakes (I used the frosting for a Thai tea cake I made), I rated this four forks for the frosting recipe. It was light and fluffy with a beautiful surface sheen, and the perfect balance of fresh coconut flavor and sweetness - and I grew up with a mom who is a pastry chef - so I am a tough critic on anything dessert related! DEFINITELY try this recipe out, you won't be disappointed.

I'm rating this 3 forks because the concept is really good--especially the frosting--it's just that the recipe needs tweaking. The cupcake is muffin like--dense and doughy. That's not a bad thing. But, with the silky, whipped, almost whisper of a frosting, it seems an odd pairing. When I made the frosting, I ignored the recommended amount of sugar and just went with my instinct. I added a bit more sugar than required, and also added a 1/2 tsp of water to help set up the exterior of the frosting. I piped it using a star tip and garnished it with toasted coconut and it looked lovely. I used the frosting on both the original recipe (vanilla bean coconut cupcake) as well as a chocolate cupcake. It went very well with both varieties. And, lots of compliments accompanied both types. Next time, I will go with my go-to recipe for vanilla cupcakes and try that. Don't worry about adding more 10X sugar to make it stiffer. It still turns out lovely and silky, without tasting too sweet.

Unbelievably good! Converted recipe to a layer cake by increasing to 1 1/2. I would double the icing - Huge hit...

Rating: 4
These were quite good, and the cake itself was moist and flavorful. In truth, I'm an excellent baker but not much of a fan of sweets, and usually just taste for quality assurance rather than eat my own baked goods. I ate three of these. I have to assume that those who complained about the sweetness of the frosting simply don't like buttercream, which has a very specific ratio of confectioners sugar to butter. I was so concerned after reading the reviews that I cut back too much on the sugar, and while the frosting was tasty, it was also too droopy. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll go with my instincts.

There should be a fifth fork available for these. Hands down the best vanilla cake I ever tried. This was my first time using actual vanilla bean (is there any going back now?) Modification - I simply added the vanilla bean goo to the coconut milk as it was reducing - this had three benefits: 1) brought the flavour out nicely, 2) made sure there were no big clumps of vanilla seeds and 3) allowed me to pour the coconut milk through a sieve to remove the brown hairy stuff that scrapes off the insides of the vanilla bean. I think next time I'll try making it as a double-layer cake....is tomorrow too soon?

This recipe is definitely worth the effort.

I really enjoyed making these cupcakes, but I was a little disappointed in the way they came out. I followed the instructions carefully, without omitting or adding anything extra. For me, they came out a bit "kicked-up vanilla" and not at all coconut. The texture of the cake was more like a muffin than a cupcake, and the frosting was very buttery. I did add some cream cheese and reduce the butter on a redo version of the frosting and iced the cupcakes as they came out. They did turn out delicious, just not what I was expecting. I think a few variations could make this really great.

Rating: 4
These cupcakes were fabulous. Every time I've made these cupcakes, they have been a hit. I do not tweak the recipe in anyway. I followed it exactly as written. It is a bit time consuming because the coconut milk has to be reduced. I usually do that either the day before or early in the morning so that it has time in the refrigerator to set. I did not find them too sweet nor the icing too greasy. This is my go-to recipe for deliciousness!!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I had anticipated a moist cupcake, like my mother used to make using coconut milk, but it was just so-so. I followed the recipe exactly and reduced the coconut milk as it said, but I did not find that it made the cake moist or the frosting flavorful. The cupcakes were dry and had little taste of coconut. I would not make this again.

Rating: 4
I thought this was DELICIOUS! I have had coconut cakes before, but I was always left wanting more of an actual coconut flavor...definitely found it in this recipe. I wanted to test the recipe first, so I cut it in half, but followed it exactly. I agree with others that they are too sweet...next time I make them (this week-end...) I will cut back on the sugar. They are so good that I want to eat more than one and not get a sugar buzz! :) Also, as others have said, the coconut milk takes a lot longer to reduce than recipe calls for--that's the only downside. BUT, that's always good time for multi-tasking :)

I thought this was a fantastic recipe, I did however reduce the sugar in both the icing and the cake batter. I also wanted them to be chocolate, coconut so I added a 3/4 cup of unsweetened coco powder and a little more coconut milk to off set that. The dark cupcake with the creamy icing looks just stunning!

I have only made the frosting, to go on top of another cupcake -- but the cupcakes with this frosting was a HUGE hit at a Mothers' Day brunch. People could not get enough of the frosting. Tried to frost the cupcakes before the frosting had chilled enough, and it was a mess. After letting it sit in the fridge for awhile it was the right consistency and texture and easy to spread.

This is a wonderful recipe. I made a 2-layer cake from the batter, but adapted it only slightly. I reduced the amount of butter for the frosting by 1/2 stick as other reviewers thought it might be too buttery (not sure if I needed to). The real kicker though was that I made homemade lemon curd. I mixed about 1/4 cup curd with 1/4 cup frosting for the middle layer of frosting (with additional coconut in the middle). That was an adaptation from my previously fav coconut cake recipe. Now this one is #1. AMAZING! Great Easter Day cake.

Sooo good. I happened to have all the ingredients (had left over coconut milk that I had bought for curry) so decided to make this. I halved the recipe, which made 9 small/medium sized cupcakes. For the 1/2 egg, instead of splitting one I subbed with 2 tbsp of apple sauce (since I used a jumbo egg for my one). Will definitely make again, though next time I might reduce the butter frosting by a third. It was enough frosting for 12 cupcakes and hubby thought it was a tad buttery.

I was looking for a recipe for coconut frosting for a chocolate cake. This turned out to be fabulous! I wish I'd read the previous reviews first, as it was really runny and I wish I'd let it sit a little before I spread my cake. I also used unsweetened coconut (which was perfect for us as it would have been over the top with sweetened coconut). The flavor was fabulous. I sent two pieces to my neighbor (who is an incredible cook) and she immediately called me to tell me how much she loved it. I am definitely going to save this recipe. It's a keeper!

I was searching for a coconut frosting recipe and came upon this one. We loved it! Didn't have sweetened coconut, so I toasted unsweetened coconut, which was absolutely perfect. I think if I'd used sweetened it would have put it over the top. The recipe was just a bit runny, so I wish I'd let it sit (or read all of the previous reviews) just a bit longer. Perfect for the chocolate cake I'd baked. I even took a piece to the neighbors and they called and said it was the most wonderful coconut cake they'd ever eaten! I'll make this again.

I ended up having to use a dram of coconut flavoring. The cupcakes were really good, though a bit intensive for a plain vanilla, and the frosting was more lackluster than it should have been for as much fat and effort that went into it. In the end, the overall effect was lovely, but I feel like I could have gotten similar results using my basic cake and coconut flavored frosting.

Loved it! I wasn't a fan of the frosting, but all the guests loved it. The cake is super moist, dense, and tasty.

Absolutely loved, loved, loved this recipe! I couldn't wait and enjoyed a *test* cupcake immediately. The coconut milk definitely took longer to reduce but was worth the effort. The cupcake is moist and to bump up the coconut flavor, I mixed a little bit of the coconut milk with a cup of flaked coconut and spooned a heaping teaspoon over the batter of each cupcake before baking. I didn't have vanilla beans but used real vanilla extract instead. I was a little worried about the consistency of the frosting but it's perfect. The toasted coconut is the perfect complement. I will definitely make again!

Rating: 4
Made these again; definitely cut back the sugar in the frosting as well as the batter. These are real sugar-bombs, even with less sugar in both components. The frosting recipe makes a lot of frosting, even if you put a giant pile on each cupcake. For a double batch of cupcakes, made a one and a half batch of frosting, and it was exactly enough. Have plenty of toasted coconut on hand (used one 14 oz. bag for a double batch), as you'll want as much coconut on each cupcake as possible - it's key to the texture and really complements the fluffy cake and light, creamy frosting.

Rating: 4
Nothing short of incredible. I doubled the recipe to make a cake which almost tripled the coconut milk reduction, but I made up for the lost time by cooling the whole pot in an ice bath. I threw the bean pods in the coconut milk while it was being reduced. I also zested lime and drizzled pineapple rum between layers of cake. Next time I make this I will try it exactly as it was described. I used organic cake flour and raw sugar. It made a dense cake almost like a banana bread. Still incredible though. I will chalk this up as a once a year experiment

Rating: 4
These were excellent. Made a half batch as a test before making these for a big party, and cut the sugar in the batter to 1 cup as per other reviews here. Will maintain the cut-back when making full batches, as there is no need for them to be any sweeter. Extra vanilla in both batter and frosting is a nice touch. Also added a squeeze of lemon to the frosting, which always helps to lift it beyond just "sweet." The reduced coconut is fantastic: resist the urge to bump it up with coconut extract, as these have a nice, light taste of clean, fresh coconut as is. Extract would probably add an artificial dimension. That natural coconut taste is what sets these apart from most coconut baked goods and why guests will remember them. Oh, and one more thing: under-bake them slightly. If you let them get to the point where a wooden tester comes out clean, they will not be as moist as they could be. Rather, bake only until the very center is still wet - the result will be insanely moist. The tops of these did not come out as smooth domes, but a bit bumpy and craggy; no matter though, as the frosting hides the tops.

This makes a wonderful cake - my family loved the result (doubling the recipe makes two generous 9 inch layers). The coconut milk is readily available in the refrigerated case at our grocery store - but make sure you use a tall pan when reducing. I think Cream of Coconut would work as a substitute, but think the reduced milk is less sweet, more coconut-y.

Who knew reducing coconut milk could be SO messy. You really have to babysit it or expect big gloppy bubbles of hot coco-madness to pop all over the stove and floor (I spent a lot of time wiping up).

While these cupcakes are beautiful and delicious, I must say I got more than one comment saying that they tasted a little like they came from a box mix - which I think might have something to do with the sweetness. However, they are moist and the toasted coconut is such a nice contrast to the cupcake!

I forgot to add that the coconut milk did take almost an hour to reduce. I simply put it on the stove though the night before while cooking dinner. You can refrigerate it overnight, just be sure to bring it to room temperature before baking. I also added a teaspoon of coconut extract to it for added flavor.

These were AMAZING! They were dense and perfectly sweetened. The frosting was incredible. I served them after making a Thai dinner; everyone woofed them down! One guest, who claims she's not a big cupcake fan, ate three! They really were a delicious, easy-to-make, vanilla cupcake with a slight taste of coconut. YUM!

I love the cake part of this for a basic yellow cake mix, it's my got to one right now. As far as a coconut cake though, it's kind of a flop since there is no coconut taste. With a dash of coconut flavoring it would be a great coconut cake with a different icing. The icing did not have much flavor either, other than being overly sweet, and the consistency was less than desireable. The recipe is at least worth making (for the cake part alone!) and then making your own adjustments to your taste preferences.

These turned out great, but I couldn't really taste the coconut aside from the toasted flakes on top (hence the three forks). I would add a few drops of a coconut dram to the frosting to pump it up. Otherwise the textures came out perfectly and they tasted like great vanilla cupcakes. Incidentally, I was asked to make these into a coconut cake for a party and was wondering if anyone (a) has tried this recipe in layer-cake form, and (b) has any modifications to make it rise correctly.

These are to die for! The only thing I did differently was make them mini-size, that way you get the perfect ratio of frosting to cake. Vanilla beans get expensive so I've substituted extract and still get raves.

Unfortunately, I am among the few who did not have success with this recipe. Didn't care for icing and there was an after taste to the cake - either from the vanilla bean or the splash of coconut extract suggested by a reviewer. They LOOKED gorgeous, though, with the toasted coconut. oh well....

these were delicious! i colored the icing pink and used sweetened coconut flakes to garnish and for added taste.definitely needed to use cake flour and coconut milk took 40min to reduce.

Thanks to all the previous reviewers! Because of your tips, these cupcakes came out perfectly. They were definitely cake-like, not muffin-like. Here are the changes I made: - Let the coconut milk reduce for over an hour, and added 1 tsp. coconut extract while it cooled. - Used cake flour; note you have to add an extra 2 tbsps for each cup when subbing cake flour for AP. - Sifted the cake flour, baking powder, and salt together. - Added vanilla bean seeds from 1 pod and 1 tsp of vanilla extract to the batter & also to the frosting. These cupcakes were an enormous hit, there wasn't a single one left. It's possibly the best thing I've ever baked.

Loved these! The first time I made them, they were good. The second time they were perfect - the only difference I think was that I took more time to reduce the coconut milk, so it was creamier, and provided a creamier texture to the cupcakes. I didn't follow any measurements for the frosting - I made a cream cheese frosting instead of an all butter one. I also used less icing sugar, which made for a less sweet but delicious frosting.

This was only okay. There was a definite muffin taste (and I tried using cake flour as others suggested). The frosting (and I'm a big frosting fan) was just too greasy/oily - it was like eating a stick of butter.

These cupcakes are absolutely perfect.. I will try the other recommendation of coconut extract and vanilla.. but as they are... LOVE THEM.. light, silky just wonderful in your mouth delight!! This is a keeper and in my short rotation!

I, I mean "the cupcake fairy," made these for a colleague's birthday. I used vanilla bean, but would use extract in the future as I think it's probably better for baking and gives a bigger vanilla flavor. I also added about 1/4 tsp of coconut extract to boost the coconut flavor (after reading other reviewers' notes). My colleague and others thought these were TO DIE FOR. I thought they were good, but more like muffins than cupcakes. That didn't stop me from eating one, of course. ;-)

Not sure what I did wrong, but these were very muffin-like and doughy. Did those who had such great success use cake flour?

I made this recipe as a cake instead of cupcakes for a potluck lunch. I got rave reviews and several requests for the recipe! I will most definitely make it again.

AMAZING. I almost don't want to tell you so because I want to keep it as my secret. These were gobbled up so fast I wished I'd made more.People were eating 2-3 at a time. The flavor is so warm and comforting that for a second, you think you're curled up in a cacoon. The coconut milk took FOREVER to reduce, but COMPLETELY worth it because it makes the recipe. I did it a day in advance. I used vanilla extract and still got a beautiful flavor. I only used 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting and I got rave reviews. I'm locking this recipe up in the safe.

I made them for Easter dinner and the kids loved the creamy texture and subtle flavour. Made the cupcake exactly as written but used a buttercream frosting instead. Kids want them again but boiling the coconut milk down for 30 minutes was tedious...it will be a special occassion desert.

I made these for the office and for children at Easter. I added a bit more coconut milk to both the batter and the frosting. Also filled the cupcakes with a bit of frosting. For the children, I made bright colored frosting with jellybeans and green tinted coconut on top. They were a great hit at the office and at the Easter party. I just gave a co-worker the recipe today. Everyone raved about how moist and delicious they were. I will make this a staple of our parties.

These--let's call them muffins--have the potential for being delicious. However, like many others, mine tasted like biscuits with a hint of coconut flavor. This was a test run for my sister's engagement party, so biscuits just won't cut it. I would suggest using vanilla extract instead of a vanilla bean. Cooks Illustrated has tested the quality that each gives to cake batters. Vanilla bean flavors work best in custards. The flavors tend to disappear in cake batters. I would use vanilla extract instead, and I would consider using cake flour to avoid the biscuit texture and aftertaste. Who knows how that will work with the coconut milk, but someone will try it :) I think I will use a coconut extract in a white cake mix to get a coconut flavor next time. I do like the look of the vanilla bean in the frosting, but it might be better to add the vanilla bean directly to the coconut milk once it is done boiling and begins the cooling process. It might absorb more of the flavors.

Yummy cupcakes! I didn't make the frosting but the cupcakes are great by themselves already.

I have made these twice, with good success. They were a bit muffin-like; make sure you use a tester so the middle is done. I didn't have a vanilla bean, so used vanilla bean paste with good results. Some in my family who claim they don't like coconut seemed to like these fine.

These cupcakes were fun to make. Like others I found that it took a bit longer than the 25 min. to reduce the coconut milk. When baking was finished I ended with something more like a muffin than a cupcake. It was dense with good flavor but would like it to be a "cupcake". Should I have used cake flour instead of the called for all purpose? I will make them again. The flavor is good and interesting.

These were so much fun to make. I did have a glich-they came out more like muffins with a slight crunch to the tops after baking. Maybe someone has a tip to avoid the muffin like finish. I used all purpose flour as it called for-I usually use cake flour for these recipes. A dense cake with the light frosting was a good pairing. I will try this again.

Great coconut cake recipe!! This recipe went over equally well with those who said they loved coconut and those who claimed to not be fans! I made half according to recipe except I didn't garnish with coconut and then I stirred sweetened coconut into the batter of the other half and then rolled them in untoasted coconut after icing. Fantastic! A definite must try recipe!

The flavors was amazing however, I had to make them in advance. The cupcakes turned into dense "pound cake" hockey pucks. I still served them because the flavor is so good.

These were the best cupcakes I have ever had. They were moist and delicious. A wonderful subtle, natural flavor and delicious, perfect icing that was not too sweet. This cupcake recipe will be made many times at my house! It is a new family favorite.

Excellent flavor and texture. Everyone raved and thought they were professionally done! Only thing I would do different next time is splurge on vanilla bean instead of using extract.

We really enjoyed this recipe last weekend! I made a couple of changes to reduce the fat content 1.used low-fat coconut milk 2.substituted applesauce for half the butter. The cake was still very rich. After reading other's comments wrt the lack of "coconut taste" in the cake batter I added some shredded coconut to the coconutmilk as it reduced and after it was cooled I added a dash of coconut extract. Our cake DID have a light, wonderful coconut taste. Another Good Epicurious Recipe!

I followed the directions 100% and the cupcakes turned out dry and crumbly - like a muffin. I was disappointed that they were not moist. I will make again if only to try to make a better cupcake.

These cupcakes are definitely delicious, but you can hardly taste the coconut. That's why I gave them 3 forks. Reducing the coconut milk was no problem. Keep it at a slow boil. The cake itself was light, moist and tender. The icing was very sweet, but worked well with the cake.

I have tried several cupcake recipes and most were overly sweet and quite bland to boot. The cake is absolutely wonderful. It has a fabulous, moist texture, which is complemented by a nice, crisp top. The frosting was a little bland for me. We mixed some with lemon juice and orange peel, which made it slightly more interesting. Next time, I might add a little bittersweet chocolate and see if that doesn't balance the sweetness a little better.

Very good recipe but i couldn't really taste the coconut at all--not in the cupcake itself nor in the frosting. Very good vanilla flavor, though. I didn't have any problems reducing the coconut milk--but be sure to do ahead as it takes awhile to cool. Do not omit the toasted coconut topping--it really adds to the flavor.

This is a great recipe and not very difficult to make. I didn't have a pastry bag, so I iced them the old-fashioned way. The coconut milk definitely took a lot longer to reduce than 25 minutes (more like 45 minutes), so I might rethink what "medium low" heat means.

These were a huge hit with my dinner guests...and were great a few days later as well. Despite being possibly the most fattening dessert I have ever made, I will definitely make them again. I topped them with a slice of strawberry and fresh pineapple for a colorful garnish. YUM!

Seriously good cupcakes - will make again and again. If you can, reduce the coconut milk in advance - it will take longer than the recipe says, and follow the recipe advice - use a larger pot than you think you need - the coconut milk has a tendency to splatter when it boils, until you get it to the right simmering temp! The frosting ROCKS!

I made these for my niece's third birthday party and they turned out delicious. They were so moist and fluffy. The icing was delicious, too. I will surely make these again.

This will be my go to coconut cake recipe. Most coconut cupcakes are just vanilla cupcakes with vanilla frosting rolled in coconut- but with this one you get the real coconut flavor in the cake itself. The frosting was good- too sweet for my taste- I will be making a coconut cream cheese frosting in the future to cut the sweetness- but this really is a great recipe. Be aware that the frosting does not look like it is going to work at first- it is very gooey and slimy looking- but as you are mixing, it becomes marshmallowy and fluffy.

These cupcakes were fabulous! I made them for a dinner party and everybody raved about them. The cake was moist and the frosting was light and fluffy. They definitely had a distinct vanilla flavor with hints of coconut. When reducing the coconut, it took slightly longer than the 25 minutes suggested in the recipe to achieve 1 1/2 cups reduced coconut milk, so take that into consideration. A keeper without a doubt!
