Made these last summer and they were good. They really need to be eaten the same day. Not appetizing when left over.

This is a quick recipe that uses the same ingredients for canning them.

these are great for picnics and the beach...however, I think they need to be eaten either the day or the day after they are made..otherwise they get soggy.

Easy and delicious. We've made it six times this summer with our own cherry tomatoes.

i made this yesterday at noon,tried a sample of it at the 4hr. mark and it was good but it didnt taste marinated inside. i tried it again at the 7 hr. mark and it was excelent. i have 1 jar marinating still. im going to try it after a few days and see how the tomatoes hold up. for processing. should be great. (also added skinny strips of yellow bell pepper) that was a real nice addition.

This is an excellent way to use cherry tomatoes and dill from the garden. We've made it twice this week already. With sweet 100 cherry tomatoes (I think substituting grape or another type of cherry would not be as good) produced sweet, tangy, dill-infused goodness. We plan on trying the brine/pickling mixture with other veggies.
