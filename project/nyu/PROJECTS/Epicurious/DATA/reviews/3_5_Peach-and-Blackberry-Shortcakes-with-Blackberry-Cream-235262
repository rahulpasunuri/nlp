This is a lovely summer dessert, we'll enjoy it again and again just as writteb. I wonder if the previous cook baked the shortcakes a little longer than needed???

I used strawberries instead of the suggested fruit and served the shortcakes on a warm Grand Marnier chocolate sauce as well as a scoop of good quality vanilla ice- cream. The shortcakes wern't as flaky as I had hoped for and I found the batter a bit wet but with the changes everyone enjoyed them.
