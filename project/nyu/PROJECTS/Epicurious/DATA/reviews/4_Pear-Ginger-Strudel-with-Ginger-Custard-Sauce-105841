I've made this five times and it's a HUGE hit. Worth the work, and I've found I need to use maybe 4-5 more sheets of phyllo dough than the recipe calls for or the filling breaks through when I try to flip the strudel over before baking. Also don't bother straining the ginger out of the sauce, people like the chewy bits. I love making this!!

This is the recipe that friends and family request when they visit. It's labor intensive, but the results are well worth the work.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a real hit. While the recipe is more labor-intensive than complicated, if that makes any sense. In other words, the steps to make it weren't hard, they just took awhile. The two sticks of butter to brush the fillo and the cookie and sugar mixture were way too much. You could probably halve it and still have enough for both strudels. There are a lot of good dessert recipes out there so I don't know if I'd really make this again, but it was impressive.
