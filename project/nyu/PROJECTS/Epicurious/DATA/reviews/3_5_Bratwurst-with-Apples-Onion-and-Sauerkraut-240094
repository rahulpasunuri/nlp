I had Moose Brats from a relative's recent (successful) hunting trip. They're like red meat rather than pork. Also agree on using less sauerkraut. I browned the brats and omitted the flour. I had no caraway - tried a little cumin. Not bad. Predictably, the sauce was a little watery, so I threw it in a pan and added some white wine, then reduced. The wine added some sophistication. Would make again for wild game or red meat brats (it was very rich), but prefer this apple-onion combo for lighter/mild sausages - http://epi.us/bTrtn

Made this yesterday for a big crowd and everyone agreed it was the best sausage they'd ever eaten. We made about 40 brats and about 5 lbs sauerkraut, used 4 apples and 4 cups broth and adjusted seasonings accordingly. Will definitely make this one again.

We really enjoyed this dish; the flavors are very good. Quality bratwurst and sauerkraut are important though. I was out of dry vermouth and used sweet red vermouth. I don't know if that's what made it taste a bit on the sweet side, but I don't think I'd change it. And, I used all-purpose flour instead of Wondra and it was fine. My husband, who is not a sauerkraut fan (at all), loved it and wants it again.

Brats are brats, but we all LOVED the sauerkraut mix under the brats! In fact, somehow I ended up without enough brats for everyone so I just had a sandwich of the kraut mix... soooo good. I had more compliments on the sauerkraut/apple/onion mix than anything else I made for dinner. Happy Octoberfest! :))

Delish! I've made this a few times and it keeps getting better! Tonight I added cubed gold potatoes with the apples/onion/kraut to make it a full meal, and swapped apple cider vinegar for the vermouth. Great with our home made venison brats. I lived in Germany and Austria and this reminds me of authentic German food, especially with the caraway and fennel.

WOW. Even though I was out of sauerkraut and fennel seeds, I found ground cumin and used Dry Martini instead of vermuth, and wow, did it come out good. I got rave reviews and my fiancee almost wanted to bump up our wedding :D 4 forks all the way!

I have not made this particular Brat and Onionkraut recipe, but I would recommend braising fresh sausages in beer (or a mix of beer/broth) until the are cooked through. The sausages will turn grey and be hard in the middle when touched with a knife. THEN you can saute them with a little fat (I just use a combo of 1/2 oil, 1/2 butter) until they brown up and are juicy looking. I am not sure why you would pierce them, as they can become overcooked and dry that way. Will be making these for the Super Bowl!

this guy loves comfort food, and this recipe delivers. i'm a big fan of some golden raisins tossed on top to throw a little sweet balance at the recipe. and as a huge sauerkraut fan, i skip the beef broth, ketchup and flour, keeping the kraut and apples as the base and broth. its great either way.

Rating: 3
this is really a 31/2 forks recipe. I followed suggestions about rinsing the kraut, and also rendered some bacon fat to brown the brats, then sauteed onions. I added some garlic to the onions too. I skipped the flour, but everything else per recipe. Easy and delicious!

Delicious and easy fall meal. The pops of sweet and sour from the apple/kraut/onion mixture is well-balanced. I recommend turning the sausages halfway through the 25-minute uncovered cooking time to ensure crispy skins on all sides. Everyone loved this. I'm making this again...and often.

To "A Cook From Chicago": I used fresh brats and browned them on top of the stove to give them some color, before putting them into the casserole. They finished cooking in the oven, and since I didn't pierce them, they came out nice and juicy. In putting together this dish, I only used about 3/4 of the 32 oz. jar of sauerkraut, and it was plenty for 6 brats. I left out the caraway and fennel seeds, and used 4 Gala apples. I cooked 6 strips of cut-up bacon, cooked the onions in some of the bacon grease, then mixed the bacon and onion together with the kraut, before putting it in the casserole dish. This is a very nice fall dish, the leftovers were great and I would make it again.

question- if you have fresh sausages, do you need to grill or boil them first? It seems like they would cook up in the oven, but it does call for "smoked"....

In celebration of Oktoberfest, I made this recipe last night. It was tasty and easy. I served it with Spaeztle, watercress & beet salad with a sour cream horseradish dressing (recipe available on epicurious), sweet and sour cucumbers, and rye bread. A few note worthy items - I added sliced fennel as noted by other reviewers (a nice touch). Also, I forgot beef broth, so used chicken instead with a so so result. Be sure to use beef - it will make the veggy mixture richer. Also, I didn't have vermouth, so used calvados.. this worked well. I also omitted the wondra flour and didn't miss it. The recipe does make a HUGE amout of kraut.. you could cut back a bit and have a decent ratio veg to sausage. I ended up mixing a lot of it with the spaetzle and that was yummy.

I have made this recipe several times now. I did use just regular flour and it worked out fine. I also added more brats like everyone said unless you are going to have way to much kraut leftover. Can't say enough good things about this recipe! Except.....YUMMY!

This was fantastic - both taste and presentation! Used fresh german bratwurst, and ApfelKorn liquer in place of vermouth (because I had no vermouth). Also substituted fresh fennel for the seeds - don't like the seeds' texture. My normally picky guests came back for seconds!

Excellent winter recipe. I used fresh brats, but browned them before adding, omitting the ketchup and used a tablespoon of cognac (brandy, whiskey or similar would also work well). Next time instead of ketchup I'll add a tablespoon of good paprika (maybe hot) -- I suspect the original recipe may have substituted ketchup to tone it down for blander taste buds.

This was so easy and so very good! Everyone at the Octoberfest party raved over this dish! I did use the wondra flour and ketchup. I've used ketcup in another saurekraut recipe on this site and had great success with it to. It adds a great dimension to the flavor. I did double the amount of bratwurst as other reviewers suggested as there is plenty of sauerkraut

Rating: 0
Yum, sehr gut! I used regular flour. Not sure if my seeds were caraway or cumin. Worked either way. Used chicken broth instead of beef - just because no beef on hand. Rum instead of vermouth. Same reason. Sausgaes were Trader Joe's Hofbrau sausages. You could easily bump the recipe to 8 sausages.

Edit to previous post re: potatoes: I would not have pre-boiled them, I would have sliced them thinner and let them roast w/ the rest.

This was so good. I followed the advice from below: skipped the ketchup and added potatoes. The sausages and the kraut mixture were amazing. The potatoes I would re-think: I pre- boiled and sliced thick red potatoes as someone mentioned below. They were very bland. I think next time I would let slice them thinner and let them soak in all the juices from the dish. Adding some mustard seeds would also be tasty, as another reviewer suggested.

Great recipe. My guests raved about it. I used fresh/frozen brats/not smoked. I boiled the brats in beer and then grilled for added flavor.

I made some modifications out of neccessity, I used fresh homemade brats instead of smoked, 2 gingercrisp apples from the farmer's market, threw in some small red potatoes cut into large chunks, omitted the flour and ketchup (no way the recipe needs it) and used demiglace from pork because I had some but did not have beef stock. Delicious! Play around with this one but definately try it!

I tried this recipe for an Oktoberfest party we had last weekend and it was a big hit with the guests. The apple adds the perfect balance to the sauerkraut. I used regular flour rather than Wondra. Also 10 sausages to feed the hungry crowd and still had too much kraut/apple mixture. I didn't use ketchup- not sure what that was meant to add but felt a little too ghetto-fabulous using it. Overall - great dish!

Rating: 4
My family loves this recipe with a few changes. I omit the ketchup - I hate the stuff and couldn't see that it would add to the recipe. I used all purpose flour with fine results. Added a copule of sliced potatoes along with the apples and onions. After a few times I've also replaced the beef broth with apple cider and sometimes use an apple gouda sausage along with the brats. I've increased the number of sausages to 8-12 because I have a big family. My husband would eat this every weekend if I'd make it that often. I keep seeing jars of sauerkraut showing up in the cupboard (he does most of the shopping!).

I have made this several times and it is delicious. We use meyts instead of brats (I think brats look creepy), any kind of apple (usually add extra) and I get around the spice grinding issue by buying powdered fennel caraway.

This has become a weeknight staple for us - we usually use around half the sauerkraut, and regular flour instead of Wondra, and it turns out great. The texture of the apple/onion/sauerkraut mixture is uniformly soft bordering on mushy, but a nice complement to dense rye bread and juicy sausage.

Rating: 3
Pretty tasty, but needs a little less sauerkraut and a little more apple. Throwing in some potatoes and/or beets would help balance out the texture, as the apple-kraut mixture becomes one spongy mass. Overall, this is a great hearty autumn meal!

I loved this! I made it exactly how the recipe states. It truly was YUMMY! I'm excited to make it again.

This is a good recipe not only because it tastes great, but because it's easy to modify. I started by piercing the brats and boiling them in beer (I used an IPA, which I found too bitter to drink) and then substituted beer for vermouth and for some of the beef broth. I found that adding mustard seeds enhanced the flavor as well. I recommend increasing the number of apples and reducing some of the kraut, as it was a little too intense. I also added small potatoes (pre-boiled and then halved) and diced carrots.

I've made this several times now and every time it's been wonderful. I always leave out the vermouth and brush the sausages with oil instead of butter. The sauerkraut is delicious, but there's definitely too much of it for the amount of sausage. I remedy this by using about 2 lbs. of sausage. Chicken broth works well, as does whole wheat flour instead of Wondra. I never have problems with lumps. I grind the spices in my coffee grinder; the bag and mallet thing doesn't work for me.

Quite a nice recipe, depends a lot on the quality of the sausages, but the apple adds a very enjoyable counterpoint to the tart saurkraut.

Thanks to all of you who responded to my question about how much sauerkraut to use. This was absolutey DELICIOUS. I made 1/2 of the recipe to serve 2. Pre-grilled 3 Johnsonville mild Italian sausages before making the rest of the recipe. Also, I sliced 3 small red potatoes and added them to the mixture that went into the oven. Super decicious, but next time I would not only drain, but also rinse the sauerkraut (as the recipe states). It turned about a bit more "krauty" than we care for. We loved our home-grown Winesap apples in this, and I will make this often

Fabulous recipe! I used fresh Johnsonville bratwurst rather than the cured smoked kind and then didn't use butter at the end since the uncooked brats generated some fat. It was simply a delicious meal - a killer keeper for sure!!!!

Wow, talk about easy and delicious. I was shocked I found the Wondra flour in my Wal-Mart baking aisle. The flavors were amazing and it was so hearty. The Sauerkraut is 32 oz before draining; and typically it's the whole large jar or in my case, I used the bag from the deli. Excellent, try it!

I'm "cook from Minneapolis" below. I don't worry about measuring the kraut, I just use the contents of a 32-oz. bag or jar and squeeze it out.

This sounds similar to one I made years ago, and then lost the recipe. I can't wait to make it, but I have one question that no one has ever answered for me: When it calls for 4 cups of sauerkraut, does one measure it after squeezing out all the liquid, or as it comes out of the jar?? Thanks to anyone who responds.

My husand (who does not care for much spice) I used 1/2 tsp each of the fennel and carawy and whole wheat flour and it was delicious. I can remember choking back the sauerkraut dishes my Lativian grandmother made, so making this dish was a great leap of faith for me! Excellent, 4 spoons

Love this--great fall recipe. To the cook from Latvia/Bavaria, not sure where it says here that this is from either of those places. So no one is allowed to cook with sausages and sauerkraut unless you personally decide it's authentic to Latvia? Weird...

This has become our favorite new fall recipe. I think I've made it five times since I got the October issue of Bon Appetit. I agree that the ingredients seem a little weird (ketchup? fennel seeds?) and the result is probably not authentically European, but nevertheless this is really, really good! The apples melt into the sauerkraut and sweeten it up and somehow the unorthodox spices really work. The bratwurst is tender, flavorful and wonderfully crisp on top. I used regular flour instead of Wondra (which I didn't have) and it worked just fine. I totally disagree with those who say there's way too much sauerkraut. After you squeeze it dry, that stuff really deflates. I'm embarrassed to say how little is left even when dinner is just my husband and me! You really do need to use high quality fresh bratwurst. Our sausage of choice is wild rice bratwurst from a local market. Also make sure that you whisk the broth, wine and ketchup together thoroughly or the ketchup will end up in clumps. I heat the water for the broth (I use instant) so that the broth crystals dissolve and it's easier to whisk in the ketchup so that it's smooth. This is very easy (peeling the apples is the hardest part) and extremely economical. A real keeper!

Great recipe. Though I didn't rinse sauerkraut as I didn't want to lose that flavor. Also used whole wheat flour and it worked fine. (though I'm curious about the difference with Wondra flour)Smelled outrageous while cooking. Filling and yields great leftovers.

2 1/2 forks. Pretty tasty. Used smoked mettwurst, which is spicier than bratwurst (which is probably pictured). Any sausage would work. The apples provided a nice contrast to the sauerkraut!

Zero forks! I am Latvian by birth and sauerkraut is a mainstay of the cuisine.My US born son-in-law loves my kraut but it DOES NOT include fennel seeds, bay leaves, beef broth, dry vermouth, and heaven forbid, ketchup. Wondra flour? Oh, I also spent quite a bit of time in Bavaria and this recipe would not make it there either. But then I no longer subsacribe to Bon Appetit either.

This dish had good flavor. However, the amount of sauerkraut/apple/onion mixture was way, way more than could be used with 6 brats. You could add another 6 or even 8 more brats and make it for a crowd. Good quality brats are key, too.

Not the prettiest dish but great flavor. Rinsing the sauerkraut and layering it under the apples gave it a sweet flavor that made even the non-sauerkraut- eaters happy. I substituted chicken apple sausage for half the brats, and served with boiled potatoes tossed with butter and bacon. Very hearty Sunday supper. Don't forget the mustards!

Yum! My husband and I really enjoyed this. I did make a few changes, mostly to avoid buying ingredients I don't use very often. I used gala apples and whole wheat flour instead of Wondra (didn't have any problems with clumping). I also omitted the vermouthand brushed the sausages with olive oil instead of butter. Excellent!

Good but not great. Perhaps tabasco or hot pepper flakes would have helped. It was easy, for sure, but not one of my favorites.
