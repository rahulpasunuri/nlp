I found this to be kind of bland, although the presentation was pretty and the overall taste ok. I thought it was a bit bland, and the crust became gummy, despite the pre-baking. Perhaps I should have left it in a bit longer. I was thinking it may have improved with a thin layer of amaretto-laced sweetened cream cheese below the peaches to block the fruit from soggying up the crust, and add more depth of flavor.

This was a very tasty easy Kuchen to make with fresh peaches. I didn't use 1/2 pint of raspberries - just what I had in the fridge so I increased the number of peaches I used to 4. I also omitted the currant jelly and it was just as delicious

this is a delight. I think it works just as well without the jam, and you don't want to risk bruising those beautiful raspberries.

Excellent dessert dish that has converted a few finicky eaters already : you cannot beat the colour and texture of this pie. Top it with a little Chantilly and it becomes irresistable. I've tried it without the raspberries, the almond extract and jelly - just the very sweet local Ontario peaches - and it was truly divine. I predict many more variations - and converts - in the future.

Kuchen is the German word for cake.

This was lovely and delicious. I should have cooked it longer as others suggested. The bottom crust was soggy but made for a kind of creamy texture. It was a big hit and felt like I wasn't "cheating" on my diet! I added blueberries too. I would cut down on the amount of current jelly. I think that it would help the kuchen (what IS a kuchen?) set up.

This was a GORGEOUS dish! Adding to the pleasure is the fact that I used my own tree peaches and garden raspberries. I took this to a patio party where there were about a dozen desserts and this one got the most rave reviews. The pre-browned butter gives the crust a wonderful, nutty flavor. I plan to take this to many parties in the future.

This dessert drew raves from my dinner guests. I baked the crust for about eight minutes before I added the peaches, and that was probably a tad too much. It came out crispy and delicious, but a touch too browned. Next time, I'll just bake longer instead of prebaking the crust alone. I used a ten inch tart pan, and it looked gorgeous. A big hit! I can't wait to make it again.

Huge success even if a bit rich. Would use more peaches next time. Cooked extra 10 minutes which made crust not soggy.

I also added a few blueberries in the last phase of baking for additional color. My only negative on this was the crust was soggy (but delicious). Definitely add more cooking time. It was a big hit!

Like others, I found the bottom crust a little soggy, so I left it in the oven another 10 minutes and it was fine.

A GREAT recipe. I make every summer for company and they always ooh and aah. Easy to do and looks like it came from a master chef!

Been making this for several years. To keep from being mushy, you can leave off sugar. More important, use large enough tart pan. Too small (8") and the crust gets too thick & won't bake through. Also try baking crust first for a bit before adding fruit. Everyone loves this tart!

Tried the recipe with mixed results. The peaches and raspberries had a wonderful taste BUT the crust was mushy in the center. I used firm but ripe peaches but could tell it was too watery when I pulled the tart out of the oven. Any suggestions on improving this recipe? Would like to try again but am apprehensive.

I've made this recipe at least 4 times when home grown peaches are in season. This is a great desert.

I tried this recipe on the first reader's recommendation -- with great success. It's delicious, and the crust is more substantial than most summer tarts, making it ideal for picnics or any event where finger-food is needed. One piece of advice: follow the recipe's suggestion to brown the butter the night before; the browning and cooling process took almost two hours.

I have been baking this tart since 1990 and have served it at dinner parties, picnics and brought it to pot lucks. Always a hit and everyone asks for the recipe.
