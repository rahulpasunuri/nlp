This is a wonderful warm winter dish - added two cloves to the tomato sauce for some rich flavour - that set it off wonderfully. I grilled a slice of eggplant, and then breaded a cutlet and placed it on top, then the sauce and cheese. Am making it again tomorrow for guests.

I did the eggplant in the oven, as described at the bottom of the recipe. Meanwhile, frying up fresh summer tomatoes (heiloom, cherry, plum) with the garlic, chili flakes & salt. Layering eggplant, spinach, tomato mixture, cheese (any). Super easy to make, incredibly yummy, would definitely make again (my husband & I don't even necessarily love eggplant)!

Meatless Monday success! Delicious and so simple. We added extra red pepper flakes to give it some kick. We plan to make the sauce for spaghetti in the future.

Simple and delicious. Much lighter and fresher tasting than the heavy standard Italian-American resturant concoction. On a weber grill at MMM I found the melt time to be closer to 8 minutes.

My husband, who is not an eggplant fan, loves this dish! The tomato sauce recipe is easy to modify; add your favorite pasta-sauce vegetables (i.e., portabella mushrooms, bell peppers, artichoke hearts, etc.), herbs, and a dry red wine before cooking down. Like other reviewers have suggested, I cut down on the cheese and added more sauce when assembling the eggplant for the grill. Much more flavorfuland healthierthan traditional breaded and fried eggplant parmesan. Great summer vegetable dish!

Fast and easy. Had only diced canned tomatoes, so I used an immersion blender to puree the sauce once the tomatoes had cooked and softened a bit. Also used fresh mozzarella and globe eggplants which worked fine.

I loved this!

I did this the baked way seeing as it's December and I don't really feel like firing up the grill outside. Turned out great. The only thing I would tweak, is to use a full 28 oz can of Tomatoes as I thought that the sauce was a bit scant if you follow the directions provided. I like my anything-parmigiana to be smothered in sauce.

This is an excellent dish. I love to cook. This is one of my favorite dishes as it's easy to make and absolutely delicious. In fact, I'm making it for dinner tonight!!

This is extraordinarily good and freezes well. I use any type/size eggplant and I don't add salt as the cheeses have plenty. Even my pickiest friends love this dish!

Really easy- I used the roasting in the oven option for the eggplant, used some provolone because I didn't have enough mozzerella; I'd also try it with zucchini thinly sliced. I used regular big eggplants, didn't have basil so I used savory and parsley. A versatile and quick recipe.

I've made this 2x: once exactly as directed, on the grill (delicious). The 2nd time, just as we were going to light the grill, a big storm rolled in. So I stove-top 'grilled' the eggplant using a cheapo IKEA rigged iron pan; made the sauce as directed but after the eggplant was finished, coooled it a bit, then chopped it into pieces and added it to the sauce, cooking a bit more. Added a bit more olive oil and more tomato to bulk up the sauce. Then boiled up some thick 'pici', Tuscan dried pasta and had a delicious early Autumn pasta supper. (Skipped the mozarella, not necessary since not making eggplant 'sandwiches'). I know a lot of people hate ratings that are based on changes - but personally, I like to read those because in my life, I usually start thinking about what to make for supper at 7pm and improvisation is the name of the game in this house!

Like other reviewers, I too used less cheese and I thought that there was plenty. This recipe is simple and very flavorful. Give it a try!

Great recipe- it was hearty but not heavy, easy and delicious. I cut back a bit on the cheese and added an extra pinch of red pepper and a layer of grilled portobello mushrooms.

This is an easy, delicious, light recipe, perfect for summer grilling with a little panache. I used fresh mozzarella, worried the stacks would slip, but everything stayed together and was loved by all. No changes at all: the tomato sauce was simple and fresh, the eggplant sweet and tender, the melted fresh mozzarella yummy, and the presentation was very nice. Only problem: a bit tricky to serve, probably a function of the slippery fresh mozzarella.

This dish was okay as a building block, but I'd definitely make some changes on the 2nd time around. First and foremost, TOO MUCH CHEESE. I'd use half the cheese or less. Secondly, double the sauce. I'm a saucy gal and the flavor was great, so I'd like more of it. That would also brighten the flavor of the dish overall. Finally, I did the oven version and I'm sure that affected the texture of the eggplant. With that said, the texture of the whole dish was too homogeneous for my tastes and I'd add either some tenderized chicken breasts or something similar. Overall the dish was "meh."

Never understood why we would want to bread and fry eggplant! So much healthier this way and deeeeelicous.

What a great, easy eggplant parm! I love the kick from the red pepper flakes, and it's a recipe you can easily play with and make in a pinch.

Easy peasy! I did slice the eggplant a little thin and didn`t have mozza, but replacing all with fresh grated parm was great. Served over buckwheat soba noodles. .. will make again and again!

This is absolutely delicious and very simple and fast to make. But it's not filling enough as is for a meal so the second time I made it I served it over rice, which was quite good. I added fresh basil on top before serving.

This was very good, and quite easy. The recipe from 2004 Gourmet (with the Panko breadcrumbs) was better, but was very time consuming to make. I will make this again.

This is great. Generally I don't like when people rate recipes and then list all of the changes they made so it is unrecognizable as the original recipe, but I made a change that really enhanced this recipe for me. I used the baked version and before baking the eggplant, I coated it per the "parmesan- crusted chicken and asparagus with sauce maltaise" recipe on this site (http://www.epicurio us.com/recipes/food/ views/PARMESAN- CRUSTED-CHICKEN-AND- ASPARAGUS-WITH- SAUCE-MALTAISE- 231883). Excellent. My husband, who does not like eggplant, goes back for seconds.

This is absolutely delicious! I used fire- roasted tomato from a can and smoked mozzarella. The cheese was fresh and caused no problem.

This recipe is WONDERFUL! Since our mozzarella was salty, though, we shouldn't have added any more aalt... we'll change that for next time. Otherwise it was delicious!

This is a very tasty and easy recipe. Be sure you cut the eggplant into equal slices so it cooks at the same rate. I cut a couple of slices too thick, so these didn't cook thoroughly and weren't quite as succulent as the others. Still, a fantastic recipe.

Rating: 4
Lighter than traditional fried ones, and still delicious. I made the amount of sauce the recipe calls for and I had plenty left over, so I'm not sure why some reviews say to make more.

Sooo good. I did the oven version and it came out great. Definitely added to the rotation.

Feeling lazy, I opted for the oven version of this recipe. It was a lovely treat and I will do it agin.

Excellent! My grill wasn't available so baked the eggplant in oven. Came out just fine, although the grill probably adds another taste dimension to the dish. Sauce was delicious, fresh basil flavor came through. Next time will try cutting back on the mozzerella cheese to save calories. Will definitely make this again.

My husband said "this is beyond good". I did make changes as I wanted a one dish hearty mid-week meal. First I sauted two large good quality Italian sausage, drained on paper towel. Sauted a lg. shallot till soft, added the garlic and red pepper for 1 minute. De-glazed with 1/4 c. white wine. Added back the sausage/tomatoes and continued with the recipe. Did not add any salt. Decreased the olive oil. Decreased the cheese by 1/2. Doubled the fresh basil and added some extra for garnish. I grated course the cheese. For assembly: eggplant pieces on the bottom on individual heat proof bowls, then sauce, then grated whole-milk cheese. Placed in the oven till the cheese melted, then added the basil on top. Presentation was beautiful. Sauce would be better if made early in the day or the night before.

This was absolutely delicious. I have made this twice now and there were NO leftovers. I used regular eggplant and added a some grilled sweet green and red peppers to my eggplant stacks. YUM!

This is a terrific summertime dish. One quick tip - do not overcook the eggplant during the first grilling step. Limiting the time on the grill to just 6 minutes results in a fantastic texture in the end.

Rating: 4
This was so yummi, very light and a good summery meal. I even did a separate one with zuchinis (for those like me who aren`t big fans of eggplants) and it was great. Got great reviews by the ppl who tasted it. But the second time around, instead of slices of cheese I grated it, it spread more evenly and was easier to cut while eating....Also, when reheating in microwave, it`s better to have the cheese at the bottom!!!!

This was excellent! I used 2 large eggplant and 1/4 of the cheese in the recipe and layered it all in a 13 x 9" glass pan. Next time I'll double the sauce recipe because it was SO good.

This was a wonderful dish, but we made a few adjustments per our own need for protein. We halved the recipe (as there were only two of us) and added hot italian sausage, which we browned and chopped finely, to the layers. It was the best meal we've had in awhile!

Sorry for the second review, but site no longer allows you to print your own note with the recipe! Make at least double sauce. Rounds are easy to cut and grill and helps make nice serving sizes. Grill time is longer than 6 minutes. Make sure the eggplant is browned and slightly soft. Layer in glass baking dish and bake until cheese is melted. A Katy approved recipe! I've made it twice now and it was much better the second time when I increased the grilling time. Used regular eggplants both times.

Yum - this is a really good, healthy dish. I accidentally cut the eggplant the wrong way but it still ended up tasty and edible. Fresh basil is definitely a must, it gave the dish a great taste.

I made this last night (with changes) and my husband and I thought it was outrageous! I used 2 regular eggplants because I couldn't find Italian. Due to the larger size of the regular eggplants, I was concerned that it would be dry, so I added a can of diced tomatoes (not realizing until after the fact that said tomatoes had chopped jalapenos in it) ..It was a happy accident, and I would make it that way again 'cuz we like it spicy!

Very good! Not as heavy as your standard parm, but still a little on the cheesy side (and this is coming from a Wisconsinite!) Besides that, everything was great!

I used two regular eggplants and cut each into 4 slices, then stacked with cheese slices as i took them off the grill allowing the cheee to melt. Then just topped both stack with tomatoe sauce prior to warming on the grill. Great recipe. Will do again

Two elements make this a really good recipe. The first is grilling the eggplant which eliminates oily, soggy eggplant of the saute. The second is the sauce which is fresh and lively due to the basil and cheese added at the last minute. I made the recipe for one - grilling the eggplant on a stove top ridged grill and finishing it in the oven. A definite keeper.

Rating: 4
I thought I had made enough for left overs...husband wouldn't stop eatting! I used 3 small eggplants and entire sauce recipe, putting some on top of each slice of eggplant. We ended up with 6 sandwiches. Will try in the winter in the oven and use olive oil spray to lower calories.

Yum! Very easy to prepare. I used diced tomatoes instead of crushed and that was nice--not as thick of a sauce but I liked having chunks of tomato. Wish I had made more sauce. I used regular eggplant, not Italian, and I cut it into eight pieces rather than four since it was thicker. That worked out fine, and I still did stacks of four slices. Definitely a keeper--I used to make the Grilled Eggplant Parmesan recipe on this site (http://www.epicurious.com/ recipes/recipe_views/views/106955) and felt like it was the best Italian grilled eggplant recipe, but this one certainly rivals it.

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper for concept and extremely healthy way to enjoy eggplant. I sliced eggplant into rounds. Six minutes total was not enough for my grill . I did double the sauce and instead of grilling for the second step I layered the stacks in a glass baking dish and then baked until the cheese was melted. It was much appreciated by my eggplant loving daughter, who ate it for dinner, breakfast and lunch the next day.

This was a very good quick weeknight meal. The only change I would make would be to increase the sauce makings by 1/2 to have extra for serving.

The sauce was wonderful! I'll use it again with chicken or pasta. I used my stove top grill...not a good idea, the egg plant soaked up the oil.

Fabulous! I used 2 large eggplants with two slices per serving. Wow, were these ever good! The sauce is soooo yummy, next time I'll make a double batch and save the extra. It would go equally well on grilled fish, chicken breasts, or fresh pasta.

This was a good recipe, not great. I made it exactly as written and thought it came together quickly. It fell into the category of comfort food for me and was earthy and satisfying on a damp, cool, early summer evening. Again, not outstanding but good.

Rating: 0
This is absolutely wonderful! The prep went very fast and the grilling adds a new dimension to the flavor of the eggplant that isn't achieved with the more traditional recipes. To keep the stacks from collapsing I inserted half of a wooden skewer (get them ready prior to making your stacks). I will absolutely fix this again!
