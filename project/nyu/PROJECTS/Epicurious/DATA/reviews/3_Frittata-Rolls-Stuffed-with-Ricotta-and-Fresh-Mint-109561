Very good. Great for a breakfast or a light dinner.

The mint flavor was too strong for most of my guests. Some likened it to a breath mint! I would try again with a different herb in the ricotta.

This was a pretty good recipe, but the parm flavor surprised me more than I expected. Boyfriend loved it but wouldn't eat it cold, I tend to agree that chilled I think cream cheese might go better with the mint. Served warm it's beautiful.

I made this recipe kind of the fly with what I had in my fridge. I ended up substituting fresh sage for the mint and using dried parsley. It was delicious! I didn't even let them chill all of the way and they were really tasty. I think you could substitute all kinds of herbs for the mint!! Will definitely make again.

This sounds delicious, but it also sounds like an updated, modernized, version of blintzes!! Sliced and served cold. I will try it.

Fabulous! I made this for a brunch and everyone gobbled it up. I double the egg mixture and then did one and a half times the filling for 8 people. It's a very simple recipe and it's quite easy to do ahead of time.

So yummy! Just really tasty to have cold with other brunch items. I did change a few things. I added an extra egg and some cream to the egg mixture, because 3 eggs didn't seem enough. I also made the filling with almost 2 cups of ricotta and parm mixed with the romano cheese. Lots of mint! The filling was delicious on its own...

Made this last night for a group of women. It was easy, but the consensus was that the filling was the tastiest part & would be better rolled in a tortilla or wrap (and much less time consuming).
