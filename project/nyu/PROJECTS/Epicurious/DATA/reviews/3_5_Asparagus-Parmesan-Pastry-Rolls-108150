I found this recipe quite good. The only problem was that instead of putting in prosciutto, I added some pancetta that was already in my fridge to a few of the rolls and those ended up being very salty. The ones without were lovely, however. Will definitely make these again.

These were pretty tastey. served as one of many appetizers at a holiday party and the guests loved them. I made some as is, and added prosciuto to others. Added additional cheese on all. I also made variations using filo dough and a pie crust recipe instead of pastry dough. I heard most guests actually liked the crispiness of the filo dough version best. Others really liked the buttery pie crust flavor. although at the end of the night, none of them were left over!

Should have read the reviews to do all of the following 1-add some prosciutto 2-take the time to roll out the pastry very thin 3-definitely do the truffle oit 4-have some sort of dipping sauce 5-no such thing as too much cheese They had potential when I made them, but with the above 5 additions, I think they'll be a huge hit in the future.

one of the first to go at every party. Truffle oil very optional but it does help to have some sort of dipping sauce. When slicing I cut each piece into 2 not four make it a large appetizer. If you aren't going to stand them up then cutting off the ends after baking not needed.

I made this a while back according to recipe and it was great. I still have people asking about these and it has been quite a while. I will be pulling this one back out soon!

I thought these turned out well. They were simple to make and had nice flavor. As others indicated, the recipe goes faster than indicated.

Very tasty! I've made this a couple times for parents and friends and everyone loves the taste and the presentation. I don't bother with the truffle oil - it tastes great without it.

Absolutely delicious. It is easier to just cut a piece of puff pastry after you roll it out and put the egg wash and cheese to twist it around the aspargus. It is faster, easier, and it also looks nice.

I have made this recipe several times and each time it is a hit. It is so elegant and fairly simple to make. Hint: I make them ahead and freeze them unbaked. Then thaw for 15 min before baking as instructed. That way, I have some onhand for unexpected gatherings.

Fairly easy to make, but were not the hit of the party. My husband doesn't like truffle oil, and may have been a little bland due to that.

Easy and delicious Made this last night as 1 of 8 appetizers at a holiday party and it was the first to go. Not sure why the time is indicated as 2 hours. Didn't take more than 1/2 hour to prepare and 15 minutes to bake.

These were the hit of my party last night! For each roll, I laid a thin slice of prosciutto on top of the paremesan before rolling up the asparagus, and I also sprinkled black and white sesame seeds on top of the egg-washed rolls before baking. I did buy the truffle oil for these but forgot to add it before serving, and they were still delicious.

A great recipe. I kept them without cutting and called then asparagus cigars.

Great, as long as the puff pastry is not rolled too thick. Used plenty of Parmigiano Reggiano as the recipe states. Did not have truffle oil and instead made a viniagrette to drizzle on (out of Dijon mustard, vinegar, olive oil, and some mayo). Even those who don't like asparagus were raving.

Warning! Blah. I made this for my housewarming party because it is Asparagus season in Holland. Blah. The puff pastry didn't cook right underneath (gooey). I used white asparagus and swiss cheese. Just had no taste. Didn't use the truffle oil (expensive.) Guests didn't like them either. If you do make this i guess go for the parm cheese (sharper) and cut in bite size pieces (easier to eat.) Use green asparagus more tasty.

I made this for mom on Mother's Day and she absolutely loved it!. Although it was pretty time consuming, the "ooos" and "mmmms" of the family made it worthwhile.

Rave revues. Instead puff pastry, I used pie crust. I also added garlic salt inside a few of the rolls, which were the favorites.

I made this for a bridal shower and it went over very well. I had none left. I am making it again today and will try half with either prociutto or black forest or maybe a few of each. I didn't do the stand up thing just cooked them on a sheet. I was glad I could fine the recipe again and this time have added it to my box.

Tasty contemporary variation to the old asparagus rolled in white bread that my mother made. It's quite elegant and my guests enjoyed it. Try rolling a piece of proscuitto around the asparagus spear for a little more flavor.

I have made these a few times, and everyone always seems to like them. I tried them from the magazine, so I hadn't read the other reviews until now. Sadly, I thought I was being very creative last night in adding a slice of prosciutto on top of the glaze, and under the cheese - now I see that others have been just as creative! Great minds.... I do think the suggestion of extra cheese is a good one, and having made half with proscuitto and half without last night, I only had a few of the plain ones left at the end of the evening!

I thought this was a tasty recipe, but felt it needed a sauce with more zing drizzled on it. It was abit too bland.

This is a good recipe. they are fancy looking and easy to make. I found that medium sized asparagus is best (the thick strands don't cook all the way through, and the thin ones are hard to stand up). I added a thin slice of culatello (or prosciutto would be good too)wrapped around the asparagus stalk. I also used a blended truffle/porcini oil (and added about three drops instead of one). Everyone loved them,(me too, and I'm not a big asparagus fan) they were the first dish to dissapear :)

Coming from the Maritimes where rolled asparagus sandwiches are expected at every major event, I made these instead for a shower I had and they were a real hit. I had to hide one for my husband.

I halved the recipe and did not find it time consuming. They were really tasty and looked great set on a plain white platter using the steamed tips as decoration. I did not use the truffle oil. You need to use a really good strong parmesan cheese and I used a little more than the amount listed.

I couldn't find really thick asparagus which would make them stand more easily but I thought they were quite easy to make and worth the effort. My husband loved them and requested them as appetizer of choice for company this weekend. I didn't use the truffle oil last time but will this time.

A show stopper. Not hard to do but do take time. Everyone thinks they came from a caterer. Placed on a platter with ham silver dollar sandwiches at a shower and it was s hit!

This takes too long for the working woman. Need to be able to fix things fast.
