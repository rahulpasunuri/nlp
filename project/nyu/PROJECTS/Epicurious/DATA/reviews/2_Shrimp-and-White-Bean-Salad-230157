Well, I liked the recipe, but my version changed a lot. I went to make it and realized that my boyfriend had eaten the white beans and that the shrimp had gone rogue on me. So, I substituted hard boiled egg for the shrimp and beans, added a bit of white wine vinegar and it was delicious! I had it for lunch over a bed of shredded romaine, chop salad style, and dressed it with a touch of olive oil and a bit more of my white wine vinegar. Overall, my FAIL at the original recipe created a great lunch salad!! mmmmmmmm!

this is rather bland. there is a really good italian recipe similar to this where you saute shrimp in olive oil and garlic for 4 minutes, mix with cannelini beans, more olive oil, red onion, parley and rosemary and it makes a fantastic antipasto dish.

I found this dish to be a little too bland for my taste. The flavors tended to meld together into not much of anything.
