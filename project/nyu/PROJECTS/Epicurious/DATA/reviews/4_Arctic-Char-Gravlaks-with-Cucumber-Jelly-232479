I used Salmon instead of Arctic Char the quality was better at the market, and I used may vacuum sealer instead of wrapping in plastic and found it,I think helped the texture and the favor was light and delicate, altough I did not make the cucumber jelly. I served it with bagels cream cheese, and capers. I could not have been more pleased. Every one raved about the taste and the color and texture were perfect and it sliced with out any dificulty I will defenently keep this as a staple it the fridge as it keep very well vacuum sealed
