I didn't expect to love this flavor combination as much as I did! I've made this salad with arugula and plain feta too, and it works very well.

Very quick and easy! I've seen the jarred feta in oil, but couldn't find it this time (figures), but as others, I purchased roasted red pepper feta, added 1/2 tsp italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp herbs de providence and it was awesome. I'm making a special trip to a different store to get the jarred feta that it calls for, and make it again tomorrow. My daughter in law says it's her new favorite salad, and my son who doesn't like feta, had two helpings!

Like others, I couldn't find feta cheese with oil. I used olive oil and balsamic vinegar with dried oregano and salt and pepper. I can't imagine it could be much better. Very simple salad but full of flavor and looks pretty too. Am making it again this weekend!

Made this the other night for guests and found it to be pretty tasty. I used regular feta and just added olive oil. Was a bit too oily for our taste, so I'd reduce the oil/vinegar proportion next time.

This is a lovely salad - the toasted walnuts set it off so nicely. I couldn't find a jar of feta in oil w/ herbs and spices. I substituted some feta that I found in the prepared foods of my supermarket that was in oil w/ olives. Substitution worked just fine.

The easiest and best tasting salad ever- had the ingredients in the fridge-used toasted almonds instead, but tasted great.

Such good flavor and interesting texture! Did not use feta cheese in oil (just plain feta), but used olive oil instead, came out just fine. Loved it!

Had this salad at our friends Labor Day celebration! It was fantastic. I made it for dinner and didn't have the feta cheese so made a vinegrette with balsamic and walnut oil...delish. Will put this in my "do over" file for sure.

This is a primo salad! Delicious and visually appealing. Great as written, or as a base for what you have on hand. I added heirloom tomatoes and avocado, which were welcome additions.

I think Easy Recipes like this are so convenient. I always stock my kitchen with ingredients that I can use to throw together a good salad. I work with Better Recipes so while I see complex recipes all of the time some of my favorites are the simple no frills but tasty recipes.
