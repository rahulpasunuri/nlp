Great Flavor! A little hard to cut. I left out the whipping cream the second time I made this recipe and it was able to be beautifully sliced with a hot knife! I also reduced the water bath amount and used a slightly larger pan. leaving it in the oven for 30 minutes more before shutting the oven off. took it out 2 hours later with zero cracks. Love this recipe!

This was very refreshing with a great lemon taste. Great for the start of springtime. I would suggest decorating the top with fresh whipping cream and thinly sliced lemon slices as the ginger does leave a less than appealing look to the cheesecake.

I made this for a potluck spring of last year and it was a hit! The use of gingersnap cookies for the crust is a fine contrast and blends well with the lemon and the cream cheese. I waited until just about serving the cheesecake before placing the thinly sliced lemon as garnish.

Did you really put garlic in a cheesecake? No wonder it was disgusting! Perhaps you should try following a recipe before you decide to dis the creator. If you followed it, you MAY just love it!

I brought this to an Easter Dinner and it received rave reviews. I made it according to the recipe. Since I don't own a food processor I simply chopped the crystalized ginger on the cutting board and had zero problems with it. Do not leave the crystalized ginger out as it is a very important element of the cheesecake. I did put a mix of blueberries, blackberries and raspberries over the slices. It complemented the cheesecake perfectly and provided a lovely bit of color.

I made this for Thanksgiving. Very disappointing. The big issue was the crystallized ginger. I tried chopping it in a food processor, with sugar, as recommended, but all of a sudden it congealed into a blob. I tried to break it up, to no avail. Tried to blend some into the mixture, but it added little flavor. I cooked it in an 8 inch springform pan, turning oven off when it appeared firm - leaving it in with spoon in the door. End result was perhaps overcooked and not very light in flavor, as I hoped. I'll try again...hand chopping the crystallized ginger.

Just made this for the first time and it was wonderful! I am back on the website now because two of my guests asked for the recipe. A little time consuming to prepare, with the chopping of the crystalized ginger, grating of fresh ginger, zesting the lemon, etc., but well worth the time and effort!

Rating: 4
I made this for a second time this weekend, and it was fabulous as before. Couple things: Make it THREE days in advance for best consistency. Leave out the crystallized ginger (expensive, hard to work with and doesn't add much), use natural ginger snaps (like Newman ginger-Os with cream scraped off) because the hydrolized goo in the mainstream version makes crust greasy. YUM!

I have made this twice and it was a HUGE hit both times. My mother is allergic to wheat, so the second time I made it, I used chopped almonds for the crust, added some extra powdered ginger and crushed fresh ginger root. It was fantastic. I threw in a little extra lemon zest and crystallized ginger one the second go round. Noticed that the kitchen aid worked a lot better than hand held mixer. Made the cake a lot lighter. I will definately be holding onto this recipe!

Ok, this cheesecake is delicious and beautiful. My one problem with it is that it is quite expensive. 4 packages of cream cheese at 2,89 each is about 11 dollars. 1 small sour cream at 1,39. Gingersnap cookies at 4,19. Crystallized ginger at 2,20 (it seems as though I got a bargain compared to other reviewers). Plus the cost of whipping cream, say half of a pint at 1,49. Lemons, 40c each. And so on. Might as well buy it ready, because on top of everything, it stayed in the oven for a full hour and 35 mins. Would I make it again? yes, when I find cream cheese on sale; might as well, since I have left over gingersnaps and crystallized ginger.

Delicious! The balance of flavors is perfect and the ginger snaps make a yummy crust. My only problem was that the crust seemed a little too soft and stuck to the pan. Perhaps I overdid it on the buttering process. The crystallized ginger is good but you could skip it if you have trouble finding it.

I made these into mini-cheesecakes for a baby shower. i had to make an extra 1/2 of the crust recipe, and the yield was 3 dozen. i used foil liners in muffin pans. I spooned a scant tablespoon of crumbs on the bottom and pressed down with the bottom of a drinking glass. baked for 5 minutes at 350. i poured the batter in and baked for about 17-18 minutes. while they baked i warmed up some peach-apricot preserves and put about 1 teaspoon atop each one. they taste and look great and are the perfect little indulgence; just the thing for a dessert buffet or other large party serving primarily finger foods. i am supplementing these with the key lime cupcakes (also yummy) on the bon appetit site, but still not listed on epicurious.

This was my 1st cheesecake & I am so proud of myself - it looked like a magazine! This tasted WONDERFUL - I really loved it. My husband wasn't so crazy about the crystalized ginger, I think I will skip that next time & just add a bit more fresh ginger to balance the flavor. I was concerned that the ginger would overwhelm the lemon flavor - but it doesn't at all. I will absolutely make this again & serve to guests.

Very nice recipe. I especially enjoyed the large cake:crust ratio. Followed recipe exactly, except my sister (who I made it for) doesn't like crystallized ginger so I left that out, but was still very good. Would add it for more flavour next time though. Highly recommended.

I made this cheesecake in a 9 inch pan and used the water bath. For the first time I did not get a soggy crust. I think the key is using the extra wide foil so you do not have to seam 2 pieces together. Also I wrapped the pan first, put it in the roaster, set the roaster on the oven rack and then poured the boiling water in, very carefully. When the bake time was up I removed the cake pan from the water bath immediately, ran a thin knife around the sides and let it cool outside the oven. It came out perfect in appearance. No cracks, no dips and no brown spots. The taste was awesome and most everybody loved it. This is the second time I have made it and I will make it again.

Made it in 9-in. pan and put a pan of hot water on the lower rack, instead of actual bath. Pan size was OK, but the cheesecake did have a medium-sized crack. Nobody cared, because it was so delicious--thick and rich without being too heavy.

Another keeper!!!! People are hesitant to try "ginger cheesecake". Have them try and be happy. Crystalized ginger can be found at good prices in health food stores - if you buy at the grocery store you will pay 2 or 3 times the price and the cake becomes VERY expensive.

This was absolutely delicious and turned out perfectly. Only thing I would do next time is use 1/2 gingersnaps and 1/2 vanilla wafers ... the crust was just a tad too gingery, taking away from the lemon. Of course, that didn't stop anyone from eating it and taking seconds!

Delicious. My didn't rise or fall nor did it get golden. Looked like the picture. Used the water bath, no seepage. Great creamy texture. I used a scissor to finely chop the ginger. Took a while, but didn't get mushy like in a food processor.

This is THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER! :) I make this every holiday. I used the suggestion of cooking for 1 hour 25 minutes and then using a wooden spoon in the door as it cools for an hour, and had no cracks without the water bath. I also froze the crystalized ginger and used a TBSP of sugar while processing and it turned out perfectly, without the gloppy mess. I always add a little more zest than it calls for (and zest the lemons before you cut and juice them, it's a LOT easier!) and it turns out SO good. Sublime. The best cheesecake ever!

A tip on candied ginger - use a small food processor and add some plain white sugar when you process the ginger, adding extra as needed. The sugar will coat the exposed edges as the ginger is chopped and keep them from sticking together.

Outstanding cheesecake. In fact, it is the only cheesecake I've been satisfied with that I've made.

Wow. This was my first ever cheesecake and I am not an experienced cook. The flavor and consistency of the cheesecake was perfect. Delicate lemon and ginger and very creamy. However, despite using 2 layers of the 18 inch foil as suggested by other reviewers, water got into the cake and the crust was drenched! This made the crust gooey enough to stick to the pan, so it stayed when I lifted the cake off. Also, if you are having trouble with the candied ginger (as I did using both a sharp knife and a food processor), try freezing it for 20 minutes or so, and then chopping it and mixing it in with the cake mix all within minutes after taking it out of the freezer - that was the only thing I found to help with the stickiness. Maybe I bought the wrong type of canided ginger? At any rate, I'm hoping these problems can be chalked up to my inexperience because the cheesecake itself tasted wonderful (my boyfriend said there was no room for improvement) - it was just the presentation and preparation that was rough. I will definitely try this again.

This was SO GOOD! The flavors were a perfect combination of ginger and lemon. It was also easy to make. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and the results were spectacular. I served this cheesecake last night at a special dinner party and it was a complete hit -- everyone wanted the recipe. I was a little nervous because (1) I had never used the water bath method before and (2) normally I would road test a recipe before serving it to guests. I needn't have worried. As with any cheesecake, make it the day before you plan to serve it. I used a 9" springform and it was just fine.

I have been making this cheesecake for Thanksgiving for a few years now and it is the hit of the meal. The flavors are sensational...you must try this! Don't use a food processor for the crystallized ginger as it will get gooey and stick together. I decorated the cake with spritzes of whipped cream and half pieces of gingersnap cookies laying on their straight edges all around the cake. Looked professional! Tip: do the whipped cream immediately before serving, or it will melt.

WOW! What a great cheesecake. I read the concerns about the ginger so I put it in the food processor and chopped. Then I added the sour cream and heavy cream and blended until I had a smooth mixture. Then I added the mixture to the cream cheese. I didn't have to bake in a water bath because I own an Aga. I will definately make this again and again!

I am a first time cheesecake maker and found this recipe to be a little daunting. However it is not as hard as one might think. I was paranoid about the crust getting wet but a little care goes a long way in preventing the soggy crust issue and mine came out fine. The flavors are delicious however I would recommend making sure your ingredients are finely ground. Mine had little chewy pieces of ginger.

This is the best cheesecake ever! Took it to a dinner party and although everyone was stuffed from all that preceeded dessert, everyone licked their plates clean and some had seconds!

This is one of the best cheesecake recipes I have ever made, and I make a lot of cheesecakes. In fact, that's what my friends always want me to bring or make for dessert. It is now on the top of my favorite cheesecake recipes, along with my white chocolate raspberry cheesecake which I got from Gourmet Magainze many years ago. I make it in a 9" springform, since my 10" does not fit into any of my roasting pans, and omit the crust up the side. Anytime you make a cheesecake where the temperature is going to be over 250 degreesF, always use a hot water bath, even when it is not called for. It stops the cheesecake from cracking. I have ruined many cheesecakes when I first started making them because I followed the receipt and didn't use a hot water bath. It may seem like a pain, but it really is worth the extra step. You can find the ginder at Trader Joe's for a very reasonable price.

This was my first attempt at a cheesecake, and I must say that it was exceptionally easy and came out perfectly! As for the bain marie/aluminum foil problem many are having, I used regular-sized foil, but creased two pieces together to make it wide enough. Have any of you done foil packets for fish on the grill? Lay two pieces of same-sized foil on top of one another, then fold the bottoms together about 1/2 inch. Then, fold again, and again, creasing firmly each time. Then open the foil like a book, and you have a very large piece of waterproof foil. I made two of these and encased my springform in it, with the creases running at 90 degree angles in case of any leakage, which did not happen. I also left the cake in the oven after turning off the heat for 2-3 hours, as I was at a party--no cracks. I hope that this helps anyone having trouble out there. As for the cheesecake itself: flavor incredible, texture creamy and light. My father-in-law loved it because it wasn't as "cheesy" as most cheesecakes. I must say, I was pretty pleased with myself that it came out so nicely after hearing from so many how difficult cheesecakes can be!

Like the cook from Fort Union, VA, I made 2/3 of the crust and 3/4 of the filling in an eight inch springform. Baked it in the water bath for 1 hour 10 minutes. Outside of those changes I followed the recipe. It was perfect.

Rating: 4
I made this in a rush. I used a store bought crust, halfed the recipe and cooked it for 50 minutes. It turned out great - a lot more flavorful than ordinary cheesecake. I didn't have any of the before mentioned clumping problems mincing the candied ginger in the food processor, but I did it first thing- when the appliance was clean and dry.

This cheesecake is exquisite. It was the first time I ever made a cheesecake and it came out perfect. I'm not sure where people are buying their crystallized ginger to make expense an issue, but I bought over a cup's worth at Whole Foods for under $4.

Excellent. The lemon and ginger was deliciously balanced and the gingersnap crust was so yummy. I agree with the last reviewer; dice the candied ginger with a sharp knife rather than make a goopy blob with a processor. I always obtain great results (and no cracks!) with water baths and it's worth the extray step, but the heavy duty 18" foil is a must. Please try this recipe!

If I could give this a 5 fork rating I would!! Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone said it was FANTASTIC...a superior cheesecake creation! I was worried about the ginger flavor but it was just barely detectable, lending just a little punch so it wasn't bland. The crust was awesome. TIPS: 1. I did NOT use a waterbath, foil, etc. I used a 9" springform pan that had high sides and it came out just perfectly perfect. (maybe a teeny crack, but so what) 2.Do NOT use a food processer on the crystalized ginger or you'll end up with a sticky glob like I did and have to spend a lot of time separating the pieces. Next time I'll use an old fashioned french knife! This is an expensive, a little more time consuming cheesecake, but worth it!

I wish I had seen the post about using the 18" foil before making this, although my crust came out OK. This cake was good, but not great. The cheesecake itself was very creamy, but I just wasn't thrilled with the ginger lemon taste myself and I think my guests kind of felt the same way.

i've been using this recipe religiously since i found it a year ago, passed it on to all my ginger addicted friends,(especially pregnant ones) and today was the first time i noticed the water bath in the baking instructions. i swear the cake is still wonderful without it. i'm the family star for finding this recipe

I'm a ginger freak. I served this today to other ginger freaks. We were very, very happy. Very rich but not overly dense. Don't skimp on the lemon and ginger; it's a perfect blend. But I should have listened to other reviewers and either skipped the water bath or bought the larger foil; some water leaked in and made the crust mushy. It was still very, very tasty, though. Note: the recipe calls for a 10" springform pan. I believe 9" is the norm, which I used; the proportions are accurate for a 9".

It turned out creamy and perfect without any cracks. The flavor was really yummy and not overpowering, despite the amount and varieties of ginger. Mine never really got brown on top, but it was definitely done. I decorated it with very thin lemon slices around the edge and a sprig of mint in the center. Looked gorgeous and tasted wonderful. Try it!

Once again Epicurious has come through with a true winner! I made this in the afternoon for a dinner party last night and somehow set the oven timer wrong, and discovered it after it had baked for 2 hours. However, it was still wonderful even though the top was a bit brown. I did not use the water bath and did not leave it in the oven any longer (it had already had its time there!). And it didn't have time to cool in the fridge overnight. Yet all my guests proclaimed it the best cheesecake they'd ever had. Make sure you do not skimp on the ginger or lemon rind. Do NOT use the pre-ground ginger from a bottle. Use fresh. I almost skipped the crust (many of us are on Atkins) and think now I could have. I used Splenda instead of sugar and couldn't tell it at all. On a scale of 1 to 10, this is a 10. Everyone went home with a copy of the recipe.

Oh Yes! This is Amazing!!! Probably the best cheescake that I have ever made.... both in presentaion and taste. (and I am a chocolate fan!).

SECRET TO WATER BATH WITHOUT SEEPAGE!!!!: You must use 18" wide aluminum foil. I made cheesecakes for years with the water bath ruining the crust until I recently read a Cook's Illustrated article which casually mentioned using a double layer of 18" square foil. Then it hit me that I'd been using the smaller, more commonly available type. I found the 18" wide in my regular grocery store. Now my water baths do NOT leak into my cheesecakes. That being said, I thought the flavor of the recipe was great, but I had another problem. Despite baking for about 7 minutes longer than recipe says, the cheesecake was not done in the middle. The internal temp reached 147 degrees and the top was top very brown, but a large portion in the middle was still quite wet. My oven temp is more or less correct. I'll try again.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved. I didn't use the water bath (didn't want water to seep through), but did put a pan of water right underneath. There was one very small crack. The texture was silky smooth. I thought the lemon overpowered the ginger, but I was alone in that thought. I used the crystalized ginger from Trader Joe's and just diced it up a little more.

I too wrapped the pan in 4 layeres of heavy duty foil and the water from the bath still made it's through.....BUT....it didn't spoil the presentation or taste. I also used just the amount of crystalized ginger that came in the jar. I can't imagine it tasting any better by adding the entire amount called for in the recipe. The combination of lemon and ginger is terrific. A true marriage of flavors. The best cheesecake I ever had. Well worth the expense and preparation time. Will definitely make for special occasions. An absolute winner recipe !!!!!

as a few of you have noted, water from the "bath" did find it's way into the crust and i put 4 layers of heavy duty aluminum foil! crystalized ginger is no cheap ingredient and 1 jar doesn't even equal 1/2 cup. i used what was in the jar and my mini-processor chopped it very fine. zesting lemons and mincing ginger are not my favorite things to do, but the taste of the cheesecake is scrumpscious. it's definitely a lot of work, but it's a great tasting cheesecake.

This is a wonderful cheesecake. Do NOT over beat when the eggs are added.(I add them all at once & mix well.) Too much air will crack the top. On the water bath issue: if you will bake the cake at 325 degrees and when done: turn off the oven, place a wooden spoon handle in the oven door (to allow the heat to escape) until the cake is cooled. At least one hour. You will not have to use a water bath and your cake will not crack. (It's the moving of the cake when hot that cracks the top-not the waterbath) I have done this for years. If it does crack: add a little sugar to sourcream and frost the top and bake 5 min. at 325. Cool for at least 8 hrs before removing pan and serving. This is the best cheese cake I have ever made or eaten. Put fresh raspberries on top. Fit for a king!

Rating: 4
Excellent! I didn't do the water bath (still cooked at 325 for 1hr 25 min, and it turned out great, just with cracks in the top. Water bath would have prevented this. With the crust, add the butter as needed -- I used gingersnaps from Trader Joes and the crust turned out too moist -- I think the cookies themselves had lots of butter.

What a delicious cheesecake. The texture was very light and creamy, and the crust was wonderful(not soggy). I was afraid the taste of ginger would be overpowering but I was wrong. The lemon and ginger were a great combination. It was a big hit at a barbeque where everyone brought a dessert of choice. I rarely cook and usually don't attempt desserts but this was flawless. Give yourself some extra time for the extra steps for cooling (don't start it in the evening)! The steps are worth it, the cake did not fall.

This was incredibly easy and delicious. It didn't rise over the pan, but it also didn't fall that much. The texture was creamy and light. Perfect. My only problem was a bit of water seepage through the foil which made the crust soggy. Any suggestions? I have thought about trying the same recipe by not using the bain marie.

I've made this cheesecake twice. The second time, I poured the filling into the crust and then added the minced crystallized ginger. The first time, it all sank to the bottom and half of it got left in the bowl. One week afterwards in the fridge, the last piece tasted as good as the first.

With the encouragement of a woman from work, this was first attempt at gourmet cooking. Normally, I would have just made a cake from a box. The recipe was very easy, I didn't have to worry about overbeating the batter and the flavors were amazing. I did have to cook it longer but I attribute that to working with an electric oven. The only thing I might do differently is the water bath. My heavy duty foil still let water seep in so the crust did not turn out as great as it could have and I think I put too much water in it. The guests at my party loved it and my boyfriend had it for breakfast the next morning.

This was, by far, the best cheesecake I have ever eaten or made--very light and creamy. As for comments on the soggy crust, try more foil around the pan and less boiling water or enough to simply cover the bottom rim of the springform pan. (You will then need to add some more boiling water halfway through the cooking cycle.)

Made about 2/3 to 3/4 of the amount in an 8" springform pan -- worked well. This cheesecake is one of the best I've ever had -- and the best I've ever made -- very rich and creamy but not overly dense. Loved the combination of ginger and lemon -- and really liked the extra zip that the crystalized ginger added to the filling.

This is an extremely rich cheesecake despite using light cream cheese and light sour cream. I wonder if anyone has figured out how many calories per slice. The crust was much too wet which I think is due to the cookies I chose. I couldn't find "ginger snaps" so just got ginger cookies at the bulk foods, which may have too much butter in them to start with. I know I cooked the base long enough. To-day I remade the recipe using a different cookie and froze it for a future party. Hope it turns out better this time. If you like really rich desserts this is it!!! The combination of flavours is lovely. Serve with raspberries and/or blueberries and a piece of fresh mint and it will look amazing!

This was a great cheesecake, but I don't think the crystallized ginger added too much (esp. for the cost). The gingersnaps is what made the ginger taste, and the middle simply tasted lemony. Still very good!

I made the recipe as written with the exception of using lite sour cream. The flavor was absolutely delicious. My only problem was that it was somewhat crumbly and difficult to cut small slices. When I make it again, I will cut back on the filling by at least 1/4 to make it a shorter cheesecake.

Brought this to a party and everyone enjoyed it (plus several people took home extra slices). Definitely use boiling water for the water bath...colder water will keep the the cheesecake from cooking evenly (esp. the center) -- I've made that mistake before.

I haven't made this yet, but wanted to comment about water baths with cheesecakes. America's Test Kitchen had an episode on cheesecakes that addressed this very subject: Why Do Cheesecakes Crack? What we learned from two months of baking was that when the internal temperature of a cheesecake rose beyond 160 degrees, it almost always cracked. The best way to prevent cracking is to use an instant-read thermometer to test the cheesecake's doneness. Take it out of the oven when it reaches 150 degrees at the center to avoid overbaking. That said, there is a second opportunity for the cheesecake to crack, this time outside of the oven. During testing, a perfectly good-looking cake cracked as it sat on the cooling rack. Evidently, the cake shrank during cooling and clung to the sides of the springform pan. If the cake clings tenaciously enough, it splits at its weakest point, the center. To avoid this type of late cracking, free the cheesecake from the sides of the pan with a paring knife as soon as it comes out of the oven.

Cooks from Cyprus and Mexico: If you still need crystalized ginger, you can contact the folks at the King Arthur Flour Baker's Catalog. I just called them and I was told their toll-free number (800.827.6836) should work for international calls. Their website is always an option: www.bakerscatalog.com.

In response to the previous post-I am not a frequent cheesecake baker, but I believe that a water bath is used to keep the cheesecake creamier. It also reduces the likelihood of the top cracking. I have heard that the water must be boiling before it goes in the oven because it would not come to a boil from the oven heat (or it would take a prohibitively long time to do so). Hope this helps.

This was worth the time involved and the expense of the crystalized ginger. I wonder tho about skipping the boiling water step and just cooking in the oven...any other more advanced cooks have thoughts or reasons for the hot water?

Twice tasty - Mother's Day and Teacher Appreciation luncheon. It's the only way I could share a slice and not feel compelled to consume the whole thing! Lemon and ginger are always a successful pair and do well to make you forget all the weight a cheesecake tends to offer to the palate and other body parts.

I don't think 800 numbers work from Cyprus. LOL. I found this recipe for crystalized ginger on a cached page in google, I hope the link will work when you try it. It's so wonderful, it's definitely worth the time to make, just make a lot at once, it keeps for over a year. http://www.google.com.mx/search?q=cache:8yyYoaxpAf8J:members.boardhost.com/auntrunner3/msg/651.html+how+to+make+crystalized+ginger&hl=es&ie=UTF-8

So, has anyone else made this -- not that I'm not enjoying the RC quips. And who can tell me where to find a recipe for crystallized ginger since I live in a place where it's not available. Many thanks.

Thanks for including Richard Chamberlain's opinion on the cheesecake. I find that our tastes are quite similar, so I'll have to try it out!

When I make this cheescake I will feed it to people who wish to remain totally anonymous and I would never so tacky as to say who they were...nor do I feel that I need the validation of who they are!

Well, if it's good enough for Richard Chamberlain, it's good enough for me.

This cheesecake is worth the effort. A tip to save time is to grate, pulse and zest- ginger, lemon and cookies the day before. The next day is a breeze through. I made this cake for actor, Richard Chamberlain. He loved it and so do my family and I.

This cheesecake had suprisingly good flavor and texture. A perfect spring/summer dessert. My friends and family raved about it. This recipe is worth your time!
