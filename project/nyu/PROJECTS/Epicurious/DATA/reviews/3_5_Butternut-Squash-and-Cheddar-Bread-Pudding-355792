I love the way it is so hard to get to write a review of this horrible recipe. I was excited about trying it and finally did today. What a terrible waste of ingredients. Bland, tasteless and not something I would ever do again. Love to try meatless recipes but this is one I will NEVER try again.

I just made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE hit. I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked it the day before. On Thanksgiving I just warmed it up in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes and then under the broiler for another 7-10 until the cheese was brown and bubbly. I could not get my hands on a baguette (the local cafe/bakery wasn't baking baguettes that day) but I did score a loaf of fresh ciabatta bread and it worked great. I would also suggest seasoning each element as you cook them - the squash, the kale, the bread/milk mixture. I think this will become a holiday staple.

I can't give 4 forks to a recipe that needs tweaking in order for it to have enough flavor, but thanks to other reviewer comments I was able to make the revised version of this and it turned out well. In addition to more salt, I added 2 tsp. minced garlic, 1/8 tsp. nutmeg and 1/4 cup white wine to the kale. (Why should the eggy bread get all the wine--it was great to braise the kale in it! Can't believe no one else thought of this =0) I only used half the kale called for in the original recipe. I concur with others: more squash, less bread; Gruyere on top; cook it 2-3 days ahead! Three people asked for the recipe and I expect it will become a Thanksgiving tradition, though next time I want to try using beer instead of wine!

This dish was a HUGE hit at thanksgiving this year. My boyfriend and I brought it to his parents' house as a side and his mom even asked for the recipe! It was flavorful and delicious, also very filling. We hardly made a dent in the casserole dish. I can certainly see it making a good main course. Would definitely recommend.

I'm revising my prior review. On urging from the hubby, I tried it again tonight after 4 days, it was very tasty. So my opinion is not so good the first day, yummy after a few.

I've made this every year for Thanksgiving for a few years now and it's a huge hit. Great meatless main course that gets you your vegetables while also feeling rich and decadent. I'll continue to make this for years. And to garlic4life who reviewed this before me, your substitutions completely alter the recipe, and it sounds like you made something revolting. Sorry, but don't leave a bad review on a recipe you didn't make.

OMG! I would not want to eat the recipe the poster before served. GLEEB! My family loved this on the try out & all agreed (11) it will be on the thanksgiving menu.

Rating: 1
Wow, was that an awful dish. Maybe it was my fault with the substitutions, but I really, really doubt it. I sub. spinach, 2% milk, onions, and french bread and added a good bit of thyme, 4 garlic cloves, ground pepper and small chunks of chicken breast. The amounts reqd in this recipe seemed off. I only needed 4 eggs (7 seemed way too much anyway), and there was only enough to make one layer across a glass 13 X 9 pan. I think it should have been more mixed together, instead of in layers. Overall, it was so bland that I picked the good stuff off the top and used Louisiana hot sauce to eat the bread part. I even made it the day before and reheated it for dinner, as so many reviewers commented on how great it is the next day. Seriously, not worth the effort, or time, or ingredients. Wow-bad.

I made this a couple years ago, loved it, passed the recipe on to a friend who thought it was very bland. I haven't made it again until last night. This is NOT bland! However, I use more salt (key) than called for, I add fresh ground pepper and a bit of fresh ground nutmeg. I sub milk for the cream and otherwise follow as written. I think the sharp cheddar is key, as is using enough--- coarsely chopped---shallots. My whole family loved this again.

Good, but not excellent for the amount of work. The proportions also seemed to be all over the place.

This was incredible. I made it Sunday night and baked it but reheated about 15 min at 350 and then broiled for 5 minutes to brown the cheese for dinner Monday night. Wow. I guess the trick really is letting it sit. I also used spinach instead of kale out of child preference. I sprinkled the layers with a little salt and pepper since some reviewers noted it was bland and I had medium cheddar rather than extra sharp on hand. This was a great vegetarian (albeit incredibly rich) main. Loved it.

This was a huge hit with my family. I didn't have the luxury of making the dish a day ahead, so I let it all soak together for a few hours prior to cooking. Also didn't use kale - used spinach instead. Delicious!!

Rating: 4
Truly delicious, but actually better the 2nd or 3rd day (as well as taking some significant time to prepare). Go ahead and make it ahead of time. You won't be disappointed!

Rating: 2
There are two major drawbacks to this dish: First is that (I've made this twice and have to agree with previous commenters) this pudding is best made ahead of time. Trust me when I tell you that, if consumed on the same day, this will smell much better than it tastes. The second is the number of pans, bowls, and dishes required in the production. Who among us loves dishwashing, I ask? My only alteration was adding some dried thyme when tossing the butternut squash in olive oil. Yums.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I made this as written, with the following exceptions: I added some black pepper and some dried thyme, and I seasoned the kale and shallots as they sauteed. Kale without salt just isn't very good!

I made this for Thanksgiving Dinner but it was not a big hit. It seemed to lack some flavor and seasoning. For the effort, it was a bit of a disappointment. Perhaps I did not add enough salt but even salted it seemed to be missing something. I gave my aunt the leftovers and she called me the next day to say that she reheated it in some olive oil and added turkey and red chili peppers and that it was much better like this.

Rating: 0
I made this last year for T-Day and like many other reviewers, I agree, it needs to be made ahead as the flavors take hold after a day, or two. I just completed making this dish for this year,but, my 21/4 pound butternut squash only yielded about 4 cups of squash. Not wanting my dish to be dominated by bread, I added some portebella mushrooms to the shallot and kale. I did add some seasoning this time. A bit of fresh thyme and summer savory. Guess the final verdict will have to wait until T-Day.

Rating: 2
This was good, but not sure it was worth the effort. I used sourdough bread and had to substitute chard for the kale. Maybe those changes were not for the better. Also, the cheddar cheese didn't seem right. Probably could be tweeked into a keeper.

Rating: 4
Yum! I don't think this recipe needs anything more, but I did alter the cooking techniques a tiny bit. I did not salt the sqaush, but salted the kale to help it wilt. I cooked the shallots until they were starting to caramelize and let the squash get caramelized as well (instead of just getting tender) by roasting a little longer. Will definitely be making this again many times.

This recipe is an excellent addition to the Thanksgiving table when one has vegetarian guests. I would definitely serve this again. Delicious.

Rating: 3
Filling and delicious, but needed something more. I basically followed the recipe as is. Next time, I would definitely add the garlic/thyme/sage options several reviewers suggested. I might also throw in a dash of heat--maybe crushed red pepper flakes or some chili powder. Alternatively, this could be sweetened up for a yummy breakfast/brunch casserole dropping the cheese and adding some nutmeg, brown sugar, etc.

Rating: 4
Love it, and can see why people serve this as an alternative to Thanksgiving turkey (ie, it's a vegetarian delight, rich and "real", not a side dish). I accidentally left out the salt, and it does not need salt with all that cheese. I did add a bit of fresh sage, and doubled the mustard. Yum!

Made this last Thanksgiving and made so much of it that I was eating it for the next few days after! It's so yummy by itself and kept getting better until it was finally gone.With squash season in full effect, I can't wait to make it again :)

I've made this several times now and is a nice replacement for stuffing at Thanksgiving. I generally make it the day before as to cut down on Thanksgiving day cooking--and it is better the second day! Like others, I add garlic and thyme and I cut back on the salt since we aren't salt into salt. Used spinach once since I forgot to buy kale and it was good as well. It was a big hit at Thanksgiving and will make it again this year!

I loved this recipe! I made it twice for two Thanksgiving dinners. Once I followed the recipe exactly, and loved it. The next time I forgot to buy bread (I know...the bread!) and had no time. So, I used an extra bag of Pepperidge Farm stuffing in place of bread, and microwaved the squash in a covered bowl (also to save time). Turned out great as well. My husband preferred the stuffing, I preferred the bread. I LOVE IT!

i love this recipe! i have made it over and over again, to get rid of the old bread in my freezer, and it's delicious, fluffy and savory. a few things: i add 3-4 garlic cloves when sauteeing the greens; i use beer instead of wine (we never drink wine here), and any greens or cheese will work. also - top with grated parmesan for an excellent crispy, cheesy crust

Forgot to buy kale at the store so used the spinach I had on hand instead. Made everything else pretty much the same as it asked. Turned out wonderful, a good comfort dish on a cold day! And very good leftovers.

Rating: 4
Loved it! I was low on some ingredients, so I only used 4 eggs, about 1 and 1/2 cups half n half and skipped the white wine. I was afraid it might come out dry but it absolutely did not. It was less custard-y but still held together nicely and had great texture. Would definitely make again - as written or with amendments.

Rating: 3
Tried this for Thanksgiving this year because I had a vegetarian coming and wanted to offer more than potatoes and greenbeans. It was good...but it was better day 2 after the flavors had a chance to meld together. I liked the contrast of the Kale and the squash with the shallots, but agree, less bread is probably a bit better. All in all a good dish!

Rating: 3
This dish sort of grew on me and I ended up making it again a few weeks later. The textures and flavors are an interesting mix. The only adjustments I made were to substitute rappi for the kale, cut the salt and used milk instead of half and half. The leftovers are great. This is my favorite kind of dish - has everything you need for a well-rounded meal, nutritious, tasty, not too time consuming, and made with ingredients usually on hand or a close facsimile thereof.

Rating: 3
I expected more. The flavors didn't blend and it needed something to make it pop, bacon or sage or something. Also the squash was too salty, and I'd cut it in smaller pieces so it's more part of the dish. Good, but probably won't make again.

Rating: 4
I understand why some reviewers did not care for this. The recipe is good but great with some doctoring up. As another reviewer recommended, I cut the bread down to 8 cups. La Brea organic wheat whole grain loaf worked well. Double the amount of butternut squash. I also roasted the squash with 2 tablespoons fresh chopped sage half way through cooking and placed 1 tablespoon fresh chopped thyme in the bread/egg mixture. Add 4 small cloves of sliced garlic when sauteeing the shallots. Last but not least, mix a small amount of gruyere into the grated cheddar.

Rating: 4
a huge hit at our thanksgiving table despite it being a new dish in a family that likes things traditional. definitely tear your bread into 1" or smaller sized pieces, i didn't and the bread chunks were way too big compared to the other sized veggies. i used maple syrup while roasting the squash and the flavor subtlety came through in the final dish and added a nice touch.

I had high hopes and ended up very happy. I substituted half of the kale for red chard. I used 2% milk instead of half and half. It makes great leftovers and would try adding fresh sage next time.

This is excellent, all-purpose winter comfort food. It is inventive, nutritious and very satisfying. I have made it for a friend's potluck and a family dinner and the pan got picked clean both times. The only aspect I have found a need to adjust was the amount of bread; 10 cups is a bit much for the amount of egg wash the recipe makes. Stick with 8/a smaller baguette.

I made this dish as a vegetarian alternative at our Thanksgiving dinner. It was really good, but I altered the recipe as several reviewers recommended. The only seasoning in the recipe is salt! I added garlic to the onions, and then put fresh ground pepper, thyme, and a bit of tarragon to the egg mixture. That gave it a good flavor. To make it healthier, I also used fat free half and half and egg beaters. I would not switch spinach for kale as some people suggested; the kale is subtle and yet gives the casserole a great nutty flavor.

Rating: 4
An excellent vegetarian option for Thanksgiving. I took one reviewer's suggestion to roast the butternut squash coated with maple syrup. Lovely! And it's true, the dish is almost better reheated as leftovers.

Rating: 4
This is an exceptional recipe. I ended up with not enought squash as one part was not good, so I increased the amount of Kale to compensate. I did find the measurements inthe recipe a little off, but here are my recommendations: Buy very good extra sharp cheddar--well worth it. Buy a very nice baguette too. The kale with the shallots was delightful. I did cook it another 15 minutes and broiled it 3 minutes. This was my favorite recipe at Thanksgiving and it tasted great the next day.

Rating: 4
I made this as the main course for the vegetarians in the family and it received rave reviews even from the turkey eaters. The key is using your favorite SHARP cheddar and a really good dry white wine. I used a nice Pouilly-Fuisse and I think that made a big difference.

Made this for thanksgiving and it was a hit. I couldn't find kale, so I substituted spinach and cooked for less time in the pan to prevent wilting. I also added fresh sage and thyme to the egg mixture as per some of the other reviews. A great holiday dish!

This was absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I browned a roll of bulk pork sausage and added it to the mix. I also found that I needed to increase the baking time by about 15 minutes. I plan to make this as a side for Thanksgiving/main course for the vegetarians. I am going to use soy sausage crumbles instead of the pork sausage.

I made this to test as a potential side-dish for Thanksgiving. It's nothing special--but I think I'm thinking it would clash with the stuffing or be too much like stuffing. If I were to make it again, I would cut up the kale, squash and bread into much smaller pieces so that the dish is more harmonious. Also, the dish seemed to need something to add flavor: maybe crisp bacon sprinkled on top.

I made this mostly as written, although I added lots of sage to the egg mixture and substituted spinach for the kale. I cooked this for a crowd and everyone liked it! (even a few who are not huge fans of squash) Next time I will leave out the spinach/kale altogether and add even more sage and maybe more shallots. I will definitely make it again.

Excellent. Used dinasaur kale and followed the recipe by the letter. Broiled it slightly longer and crisped the kale on top, as well as the cheese. The flavors were clean and simple.

Good, filling and uninspired. We are a vegetarian household so I am always looking for a new/interesting/unique dish, especially one dish meals. We don't shy away from lots of prep - how can you if you cook vegetarian regularly. We love the ingredients and have to agree with other reviews that the sum of the parts make a disappointing whole. It wasn't bad but not worth the trouble for the taste. I did add a but more cheese while putting it together because it looked too skimpy, but it was not worth making again. Maybe lots more cheese, mustard, a big handful of herbs would help. They would help to make it an entirely different dish :)

I made this recipe, but made some changes. I did not use Kale (I know, gasp!) and instead used 1lb cooked ground beef seasoned with minced onions, garlic, etc. I layered beef instead of Kale. I also added 1 tbsp of Sherry to the mix too. I added more garlic, but the goal was a more 'meaty' dish. Turned out wonderful and well worth the effort!!! I would make again, but only with the changes/additions I made otherwise it could turn out rather bland.

Made this last night as an accompaniment to leftovers. Added thyme. It was a huge hit. Next time I'll use white cheddar. I like the reviewer's idea below of adding in some layers of peppers/onions. Maybe more shallots instead. Not sure if garlic will add to the dish. Used a turnip/collard/spinach greens mix instead of kale.

Making this as a side dish for a dinner party tomorrow. Baked the squash and shallots and chard instead of kale. Then after reading the reviews I decided to add another layer with more flavour so sauteed onion, garlic and chopped red pepper with a bit of chipotle. Am afraid the bread will get too soggy overnight so I'll do that part tomorrow. I think the coloured layers will look great in a glass casserole. Will let you know how it turns out

Why would anyone rate a recipe they haven't even tried? It devalues the usefulness of this tool. That said, I really WANTED to love this recipe. I love all of the components, but combined, it just needed something more for me. I agree with the previous suggestions of garlic, more mustard, and maybe some fresh sage. That might give it more "umph".

While I haven't made this recipe, the flavor principles and preparation technique appear to be sound and well balanced. I will try this in the near future. I'd have to agree with the other reviewer about making changes and then reviewing a recipe. It's not the same recipe after that. Also, in answer to the chef from Louisville, yes you can freeze bread pudding but it needs to have enuogh mosture in it to keep it from becoming too dry. At my restaurant we freeze our bread pudding and it comes out great every time. SS

Made it for Canadian Thanksgiving. Made them in individual metal rounds, liquid egg mixture made them very sticky to get out...would use parchment lining next time...I think would work well in medium muffin tins, I prefer that to a 'casserole' where the edges can be crusty and middle soft. Presentation better, too. My son is a chef, restaurant owner, and he enjoyed this, too, but found it filling. Make smaller ones next time.

If I had the opportunity to post 5 forks I'd have done so. This dish is wonderful and so right for a fall dinner.

My family loved this. Changed it to locally grown cauliflower rather than squash as this is what we had, and milk/yogurt rather than cream. I think a fourth star might have been warranted if I had added some fresh herbs to the bread/egg mixture, to deepen the flavor. Yum!

I enjoyed this recipe, however I don't think the kale was a very good compliment to the rest of the dish. Everything else was deliciously soft & comforting, and the kale gave an annoying crunchy contrast that I didn't like.

Loved this recipe! I made a few minor changes based on what I had: added garlic, used regular curly kale, used a seedy multigrain bread, and used a mix of cheddar and Manchego (probably more than the recipe called for...I didn't measure). I highly recommend the garlic- it brightened up the flavors well. Also, the nutty manchego was a nice compliment to the squash, I don't think I would use all manchego, but the mix was great. The multigrain bread was also a nice addition. It was a bit too eggy, but that might have been due to the bread I used being to moist. I'll eyeball it next time.

I made this for a potluck and even the picky eaters liked it. I didn't have a baguette laying around so I used up my left over white and wheat breads and I left out the wine.

I made this for a fall birthday party and everyone loved it. I made it exactly as the recipe called, and it was delicious. I like the suggestion of roasting the squash with a little brown sugar.

I am not a lover of butternut squash but the picture I saw of this dish looked so good I had to try it! I agree with the review that said a lot of prep since you have to roast the squash and cook the kale before putting it all together, but it is sooooo worth it. Loved the flavors. Roasted the squash with a touch of brown sugar and nutmeg. Delicious! Waiting to see how the piece I froze turns out.

I made this recipe for my family tonight and despite their initial skepticism, everyone loved it! The only thing I did differently was to add some of the fresh sage from my garden when I sauteed the kale. The baguette I used was pretty large, so I didn't have any excess egg mixture, but the bread was soaked enough so that it didn't bake up dry. It was a delicious fall entree and I will make it again soon. Has anyone tried to freeze this or something similar with any success??

A crowd pleaser in our picky coop. Followed recipe mostly but used 2% milk which was on hand. Bumped it up with 1/2 cup plain low fat yogurt and extra 1/4 pound cheddar - Trader Joe's 'Extra Sharp Canadian'. And some black pepper. Even better the next day.

Used a relatively small baguette - asiago cheese variety - maybe that led to my dish being NOT dry. Baquettes vary tremendously in size and dryness. Used whole milk, not half and half, since that's what I had on hand. Used onions, not shallots, and sauteed them in 2 Tbsp. butter. Added about 1/2 of a boursin cheese to kick up the flavor. We all though it was great... good balance of flavors. Look forward to seeing what other cooks are bringing to the table. Maybe add a little creme fraiche next time for a little extra something. Great side dish for anything... plus a perfect main dish for vegetarians.

Oh, I really wanted to like this one. Love all the ingredients. Followed recipe exactly. Too dry and it really seemed too sweet (the squash, I guess) so the flavors really didn't blend together well, in my opinion.
