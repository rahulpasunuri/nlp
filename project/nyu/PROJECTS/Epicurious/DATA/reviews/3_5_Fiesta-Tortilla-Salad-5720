This is a wonderfully refreshing salad with lots of tastes and textures. I would, however, recommend using a red leaf lettuce or romaine (something with nutritional value!) instead of iceberg lettuce. The cabbage made the salad somewhat bitter and therefore rendered inedible by my children.

I've made this salad twice now and it's one of my favorites. I love the sweet taste of mango with the crunch of jicama. I used Napa cabbage instead of regular green cabbage and jalapeno in place of the pasilla because that's all I could find. I also opted to bake the tortilla stips the second time for a healthier version.

This was a very interesting and unusual salad. I can't decide how much I liked it.

I made this recipe last night and it is fantastic!!! The dressing is divine!!! Such a kick! I brought some to work and my friends all asked for the recipe!!! I did add pieces of grilled chicken and it was a great main course.
