To crazyjosie below: This is a recipe in the tradition of James Beard -- it decribes a cooking technique, in this case braising, using a very simple ingredients. The amounts are either self-explanatory ("halfway up the side of the meat") or at your discretion (what looks right). There are a lot of complex "osso buco" type recipes on this site that produce complex tasting final products. This is simple, rustic version that would be perfect when you have plenty of time to cook, but want to spend as little time as possible in the kitchen.

There are no ingredients listed for this recipe. The instructions states them, but not the quantities. I am going to try it using my common sense but if somebody knows them, could you please list them here in the comments section.(I will post my results and quantities used.)
