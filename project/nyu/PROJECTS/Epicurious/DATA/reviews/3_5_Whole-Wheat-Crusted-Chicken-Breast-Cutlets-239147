This recipe was 'ok', the chicken was crunchy, but overall I thought the taste was strange. My sister said they tasted like frozen fried chicken from the supermarket, so...probably won't make again.

They're crunchy and there wasnt too much liquid but I'll keep looking for a good chicken nugget replacement.

This recipe is tasty, fast, and easy! I Made my own breadcrumbs and added rosemary and mushrooms. Everyone loved it!

Recipe is easy and fast. I pounded the chicken breasts to uniform thickness and they were all done at the same time. The chicken is tasty, my kids ate it, but it is not exciting, hence the 3 forks. I'd add fresh minced herbs next time.
