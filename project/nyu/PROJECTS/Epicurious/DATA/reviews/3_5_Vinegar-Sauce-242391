This Vinegar sauce should make you eyes water up...and how did the person ruin a entire pork with this...your not suppose to use the vinegary sauce on the butt smoking it..use it for the meat after you smoke it...

I meant to say if you like most people are..with BBQ sauce it will be sweet...not vinegary...like I like it. It take a while to enjoy REAL BBQ sauce...you should let this sauce sit in room temp overnight to be right...I adjust mine with a little more red pepper flakes...a good and a real BBQ rest..in NC should offer both sauces..on the table that sit out in room Temp ..sometimes for days...it gets better the longer it sits..

For all the folks that did not like this...its because you are you to the sweet BBQ sauce you get ...if your from the south like me..you should know that North Carolina sauce is made two ways...west portion of the state likes sweet sauce and eastern likes a sauce made of about 90% vinegar...so that is the way it is...

I´m sorry but I really don´t get this recipe. I usually love this site and escpecially if the reviews are as raving as this one but this sauce was absolutely horrible. It tasted of nothing but vinegar. Could this recipe be wrong in some way? 2 cups of vinegar is quite a lot. I tried everything, adding sugar, adding salt, boiling it down but alas it never improved.... Very disapointed...

I made this recipe tonight and the pork was perfect. Too cold/rainy for the BBQ, so used convection oven. Great reasult. As for the vinegar sauce...some like it hot, some not...so I served the sauce apart.

Not your typical cole slaw, but an excellent addition to pulled pork. I used siracha instead of the different peppers, and it was really yummy. Not sure I would want it by itself, but with the pork it is GREAT!

I made this sauce without the water mentioned below and had it with coleslaw...very tasty. I won't go back to a mayo-based slaw wilingly!

I made this sauce with no water and added a little more regular white vinegar because I didn't have quite enough cider vinegar. It was a huge hit on the Boston Butts I did and then I used it again on chicken for the grill. Marinated the chicken in it for 4 hours and grilled long and slow...the chicken was actually my favorite way to use it. Excellent all-purpose sauce!

Yes, I added the mentioned water that wasn't written into the ingredients list. Basically, I added double the volume of all the other ingredients. Lovely sauce to which I then tasted and added scallions,an allspice berry and clove. "Nuked" it for 4 minutes on high then an additional 3 minutes at 70%. Oh yes and I cut back on the amount of ketchup as I prefer a thinner sauce. I should confess that I made the pork shoulder in my crockpot ( a disadvantage of living in an apt. is limited chances to grill) and also used the reduced juices from the rendered meat in the sauce. This doesn't change my opinion that this is a great base sauce that allows you to experiment with ease. Also this is a great recipe for freeze ahead meals......in fact this dish will go camping with me this summer packed in a ziploc bag waiting to be heated up on the grill.

I haven't bothered to review a recipe on this s site for ages. I made this sauce and it is wonderful. Kudo's to the Cook from Seattle. I did exactly the same, before I read these comments. For those that find this too tart, start with RAW apple Cider vinegar available at natural food stores. Before adding more sugar, try adding more salt. Sugar does not reduce the acidity of vinegar. If it is still too tart add a different type of sweetening agent such as Grade B pure Maple Syrup or Dark Agave Syrup or even Blackstrap Molasses, to create a deeper bottom note. Bringing this sauce to a boil and simmering for a few minutes will also reduce its edginess. The only change I made was to add a little Dijon Mustard, as I am a mustard lover. Since I planned on adding pan juices to the sauce I also added a shot of bourbon. I divided the sauce after simmering. I added pan juices to about half of the sauce, and brought it to a boil and simmered for a few mins. When it cooled I tossed w/ pulled pork. The other portion I used as a condiment at serving time. As has bees noted: This is a very nice sauce for those of us who do not care for thick and sweet BBQ sauces so common on the west coast. Enjoy!

Water is not listed in the ingredients but it's part of the recipe... (incidentally, I consider this a typo) Just wondering if those who have made this did so using the water... or left the sauce as it was? I tasted the sauce, pre-water, and rather liked it. Will let it sit over night to determine if the water is necessary...

WOW! Made this today for 4th of July barbeque and it was a HUGE hit. Used on spare ribs with the rub form the bbq recipe, and it was absolutely phenomenal. I will DEFINITELY make again! It seemed like a lot of pepper, but it's not too spicy if you use it as a basting sauce. WONDERFUL.

This is fantastic as is...I did use cayenne instead of black pepper. Doesn't need an increase in sugar!

Authentic and delicious. I would suggest leaving the proportion of sugar the same as in the recipe, this should not be sweet.

Excellent Sauce! Will confess though that I added three times the brown sugar after making it according to the recipe. It was much too tart until I did. Added the sugar until it suited my taste and it was unbelievable!

Great with the pork. On its own, I would not eat it. I was afraid to add too much to the pork because it was so hot, but I actually found you could add a lot of it without overpowering the pork. Would definitely make again

This is a great recipe. I didn't grill it, but made it in my slow-cooker. I applied the rub the night before and got it out and put it on the cooker in the morning before work. After it was cooked, while I was pulling the meat apart, I reduced the juices that had accumulated in the cooker on the stove and then added that to the vinegar sauce. It was fantastic. My husband had three helpings! Would definitely make it again this way. It tasted great and was super easy.

This is a very unusual sauce: thin and peppery. It provides a nice contrast to the smoothness of smoked, pulled pork. It's also a nice change from the thick, sweet barbecue you find more often on the west coast.

In my copy of the Barbecue Bible the pages this recipe is on are dark and nasty from all the times I've mixed rub and sauce over them. This recipe is a good balance between Eastern and Western NC style bbq and fans of both will like it.
