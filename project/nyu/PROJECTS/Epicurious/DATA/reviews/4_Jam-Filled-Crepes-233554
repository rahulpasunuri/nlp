Great family breakfast recipe! Children loved these. I also made savory crepes with the batter.

I love this recipe. I omit the brandy and just fill the crepes with homemade raspberry jelly. It is my 7 year old daughter's favorite breakfast.

the texture and flavor of these crepes are the best I've had. I've been making crepes for about 15 yrs now, but this will be my new recipe. I did not have brandy, so I substituted vanilla extract. I also like to add a dash of cinnamon to my batter. For the filling, I use berry jam, and as of late, been filling with semi-sweet chocolate chips...TO DIE FOR! Try it! Any if you're a choc rasberry fan, use the choc chips and ras jam together. Delicious!

Turned out great! Best crepe recipe yet - my husband, crepe authority in the house, only added a bit of powdered sugar. Really delicious.

We are at vacation house in Southern Greece and ofcourse w/out my recipes so I used this one to make crapes for my family for breakfast. They turned out great! My children finished them up - even our picky daughter. I filled some with nuttela and bannanas and some with wallnuts and honey!

AMAZING with nutella!

I didn't have whole milk so I used 2% milk and added a tablespoon of butter as well as a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I have to say that they turned out great for my first time making crepes. I also didn't have any brandy so I just spread raspberry jam on a few and Nutella on the others and they were fantastic. Excellent recipe and easy to prepare.

This was good. I will, though, next time put in less than 1/4 cup in the skillet. I like mine thinner.

I made this with 2% milk and thought it was fantastic. I've always assumed crepes would be difficult but this recipe makes them easy. I filled them with chocolate chips instead of jam, but I think they would work with anything.

this recipe is just perfect. I made mine with buttermilk, though - and I didn't bother melting the butter beforehand. Delicious.

These are excellent crepes - although I mixed them by hand and added 1 tsp. vanilla to the batter. I also did not wait for an hour to cook them. They were super fast and yummy - we had them for breakfast with fresh raspberries and maple whipped cream.

I used 2% instead of whole milk. Somehow the first crepe I made was incredibly salty, so I tossed in a few tablespoons of sugar and they tasted great. Instead of the jam mix I served with chocolate ganache and strawberries - delicious!
