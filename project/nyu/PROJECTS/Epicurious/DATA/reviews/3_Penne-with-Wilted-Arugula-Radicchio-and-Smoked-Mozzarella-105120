I don't get the complaints about bitterness or lack of flavour. Smoked cheese, basil, garlic, lemon and peppery greens add plenty of flavour for me. I sauteed some mushrooms and threw them in too, because I think everything is better with mushrooms. I also think the whole dish needs to be heated a little at the end to get the cheese to melt well. Easy and very fresh-tasting.

i didnt use any cheese and i added 3/4 cup white wine and thought it was pretty good.

I've made this dish many times and really enjoy it. I usually saute or grill the radicchio with olive oil, salt, and pepper first to let it mellow a bit. Instead of just wilting everything at the end with the pasta water i may throw it all in a pan for a minute or two at the end. It's a favorite standby for my husband and i.

I really can't recommend this recipe. Anyone considering it needs to think carefully about the ingredients--it tastes exactly like the ingredient list. To me, it was bitter and thin on flavor. I really think something is needed to counter the bitterness (carmelized onions?). Frankly, I've got too many wonderful pasta recipes to spend time making this one suit my taste.

I haven't made this yet but It looks interesting. I love smoked mozerella but I think I will have to substitute radiccio for spinach. The Idea of radiccio and arugula in one dish is just too much bitterness for me.

Mixed feelings about this one but I'm optimistic that some minor changes would help. First, I used Trader Joe's brown bag pasta, which is so robust that 1.5 times the oil and double the garlic wouldn't hurt. Second, and also because of the pasta, I would double the pasta water to soften the greens. A dish with great potential, but our initial execution was lacking.

I ommitted the basil (I like other reviewers thought this an odd combination), and cut the pasta by about a third. The store had smoked fontina and not mozzarella; the fontina was great but had a slight bitterness that I don't think the mozzarella would've had. It's a lovely recipe, quite good for us, but not something I'd make more than a couple times a year.

Pleasant enough.

Omigod, this is good eatin'. I don't get the review about "not enough flavor" (!)--with that melted smoked mozzarella, your tastebuds have to be as wilted as the arugula to not get the kick in this recipe. The smokiness of the cheese makes a great pairing with the nuttiness of the arugula; I could even do w/o the basil, though it's a nice touch. And, on top of that, it's simple to make, provided you've got the ingredients lying around. A keeper.

This dish does not have enough flavor and was disappointing. I don't know what you could add to it to make it taste better. It is definitely missing something or the ingredients just don't go together.

Great recipe for everyday cooking. I doubled the greens and other ingredients (except the oil) but did not double the pasta. Added dried red pepper flakes for a little spice.

Made this a day ahead for a lunch party, adding only the basil at the last moment. I thought it worked very well and enjoyed the flavor combination. Be sure to cook pasta in well salted water, and season "dressing" vigorously, as there is a lot of pasta here. The cooking liquid is important ingredient too, as I needed probably a cup to keep things moist (I actually used chicken broth). Add the cheese quickly so that it melts a little at the edges. I think this will be much sharper dish (with all the arugula) if served immediately. P.S. Pairs well with the Turkey Tonnato dish featured in the same issue.
