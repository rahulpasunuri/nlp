Excellent flavors together, really yummy. As per previous comments, I did mix of pan-fried and oven baked (some open faced, others sandwich). Easily preferred open-faced in oven (pre-toasting bread first) as wasn't as messy as other ways (watch butter amount if pan frying or gets too greasy). Did 1/2 golden raisins and 1/2 dried cranberries which was great. Eaten all up at a holiday party for hors d'oeuvres.

Loved. I used a country whole grain bread and regretted not using a bread with fruit or nuts. Would have added another layer of flavor. I too, prepared as open faced sandwiches and broiled. I fried/grilled the bread prior to topping on both sides with half butter and half olive oil. Loved. Hubby beat me to the leftovers cold the next morning, so you know it's yummy!

Absolutely heaven. Even took the ingredients camping so we could eat well!

what a completely unforteatable sandwich! what i changed was toasting chopped walnuts & kneading them into a local blue cheese-pretty mild from wisconsin-billy blue. i spread a layer on top of a french asiago roll, topped with the compote-i used yellow onions because i don't have white, i also used dried cranberries because i do not stock raisens. i think the things i added to this recipe only took a fantastic recipe over the top. this is super excellent :-) i'm very happy this idea was shared.

This was awesome. Did exactly like the previous reviewer. Was a hit and could stand for a while at room temp.

What a hit 0 served with cheese and chocolate fondue at a wine tasting party. Like others, I adjusted slightly to serve as an appetizer: toasted the bread, smeared on cheese and broiled to melt. Then topped with onion/raisin jam, left open faced and cut into finger sized portions. Served at room temperature. Absolutely delicious.

I too used this as an appetizer by cutting bread rounds with a cookie cutter and serving open faced after quickly broiling to melt the cheese. My guests loved them.

Served this mixture over grilled polenta rounds. Excellent for a cocktail party.

I only used the caramelized onion part of this recipe to make hors d'oeuvres, which were outstanding. I used only 1 tbsp of rice vinegar, and a little less than 2 tbsp of brown sugar. I added dried blueberries instead of raisins. I thinly sliced and toasted baguette rounds, spread a thin layer of hot pepper jelly over them, then spooned the onions on top. Simply superb.

I wouldn't really call this a "sandwich." To make it one, I barely buttered both halves of the bread and toasted them. Piled thinly sliced Angus roast beef from the deli on one half, topped that with gorgonzola, and broiled for a few minutes until the cheese melted. I spread the onion jam on the other half of the bread and ... voila! A sandwich.

Everyone loved it. The taste is very sophisticated for something pretty simple. I ended up taking the top piece of bread off and broiling for a few minutes like another cook. Just make sure the bottom half of your bread is toasted before layering the cheese and onions otherwise it gets soggy. Still good but hard to eat that way.

A wonderful appetizer or could even have as a lunch.My husband keeps asking for me to make the sandwhich again for him. One tip, make the onions the day before to save time. Would also be good if you used honey as well

Was out of raisins, so I substituted chopped cranberries and apricots. This sandwich was so good. I will make it again and again.

I addapted this recipe to serve this as an appeteizer for a large group of people. I broiled the blue cheese on top of the toasted bread and topped with the onion jam, leaving the sandwich open face style and then cutting into bite size pieces for hors'd oerves. They were a huge hit!! Definately will make again. Especially since they can be served room temperature. Nice recipe Epicurious!

Only had enough to make one sandwich & my husband said he was going out after work, so this was perfect. Made the sandwich & then went down to the basement to get the wash out. Come back upstairs only to find my husband eating my sandwich...of course thinking I had enough to make more. We had to share a small sandwich, but oh man was it good!

Pretty good, but I used less butter than called for and there was still too much.

So, I cheated and used not only the panini press but some pre-bought onion jam, and . . . I usually hate cooks who bastardize a recipe posted here and then whine about how bad it was, but you know, a panini from this recipe with store-bought onion jam was FABULOUS. I'm sure the original is great too but trust me, if you want to be creative along these lines, the results are well worth it!

Delish! I used regular yellow onions and Health Nut bread (it's what I had on hand), and the sandwiches came out terrific. I loved the combination of sweet caramelized onions and salty but creamy cheese.

So good!! It tastes great with the raisin bread that someone else suggested!

This is a very rich dish, but quite tasty. Make sure you have plenty of good red wine to drink with it.

The blue cheese and onion jam make a delicious combination. However, don't make the same mistake I did by baking your sandwiches instead of frying them. Baking yields a very soggy bread from the onion mix and makes the sandwiches impossible to cut into small pieces. This is rich and needs to be eaten in small bites. Next time I'll follow the directions...Duh.

I served this at a cocktail party for a friend's birthday and it was an instant hit. It's perfect with grilled steak brochettes and a big glass of red wine!

Knockout blending of flavors with convenient division of work. I used Vidalia sweet onions and half with English Stilton, half with a fine blue -veined Gorgonzola, with guests comparing flavors. Next time, I will toast with less butter as the touch was slightly greasy.

This was fabulous with a zin or merlot!! We had a wine tasting party for many sales people from Ravenswood and everyone loved it!!!

Absolutely delicious! The sharpness of the blue cheese and the sweetness of the onions complemented each other perfectly. I had pre-made crepes in the fridge, so I made those instead of sandwiches with a few walnuts added to the filling.

Made this as an appetizer for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Used pecan raisin bread from the bakery and sliced it myself - some thin, some thick for a variety. Both were fabulous. Making the onion jam a day or two before enhances the flavor. A keeper!

I made these appetizers for a group of chefs and wine makers and they were totally impressed. All platters came back empty.
