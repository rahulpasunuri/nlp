Not sure yet what I think of these--I am hoping their flavor develops over time, and the tea comes forward more. I used the honey I had on hand, which was maybe more strongly flavored than I would have preferred, and the cookies taste very much of honey. REGARDING the whole stencil thing--forget all the silliness. Put the dough in a large ziploc bag, snip a corner off (very small opening) and pipe the dough onto parchment lined pans (no need for the silpat either) It is very easy to work with. You can make zigzags or straight lines or whatever you'd like. You can also drape them across chopsticks or spoon handles or whatever to curl them when you take them off the pans after baking.

I gave these a trial run three years ago and they became my mother-in-law's favorite. Now that I make them every year, I'm constantly on the search for a way to make the stenciling (sp?) process easier. This recipe would get 4 forks if not for that. I've tried baking them in rounds and it's just not the same. This year,I've purchased a cake board which will be cut to the size of my cookie sheet and turned into one giant stencil. We'll see how it goes.

Forget the styrofoam plates. I was a pastry cook at a fine-dining restaurant and we used heavy plastic sheets--about the same thickness as the lid of a sour cream or 1-quart yogurt container. Which you could use, though they're a bit small. But check your food containers for that gauge of plastic. When you put the batter on the stencil, scoop up a little with the small offset spatula, spread it in the stencil opening, then sort of scrape the edge of the spatula evenly over the stencil so there's no batter left on the stencil-- there's only batter in the opening. If you're curling them around a dowel or spoon handle and they cool too much before you get to all of them, pop the too-cool ones back into the oven for 30 seconds to a minute. They'll soften up again nicely.

These were some of the worst cookies I have ever tasted in my life. I made them at a cookie party and universally everyone agreed that there were awful. They looked great, but the taste-- and aftertaste-- was horrible.

I also had a horrible time with the stencil, and finally started to draw out thin lines of batter. They spread out into nice-looking cookies, and very tasty

These are yummy! Mine didn't turn out beautiful like the picture, perhaps I made them too thick?

Very good recipe! Based on the feedback in the first review, I made these in rounds and they turned out great. I also made them in mini muffin pans and they turned out well too. They had a cake like texture but the same flavor.

Really yummy and delicious, and a big hit at the holiday party, but the stencil thing was impossible to deal with and a major pain. I abandoned that, and just made tiny drops -- the dough spreads out massively and so even tiny drops turn into thin, crisp rounds -- but leave lots of space.
