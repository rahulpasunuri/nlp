This bread is soooo good! My husband requests it all the time! Tastes great, easy to make, and looks fancy as well!

We enjoyed this for the most part. I made my own pizza dough (very easy and much better than any refrigerated version) and used yellow squash, red onion, and zucchini. It was soft and very cheesy. Maybe too cheesy? I couldn't decide if less cheese would have been better or if I should have used an unflavored version and added my own flavorings. Either way, it was tasty and I would make it again, perhaps with some adjustments.

Pure sweetness - I loooove this recipe! So simple, make it all the time. Sometimes I mix sage of other herbs in with the dough. This bread alwas makes every think yummy thoughts :)

the flavors were very good, but there was a bit too much of the garlic-herb cheese. I'd definitely make it again but I would either cut back on the herbed cheese or just do away with the double layer.

Delicious and easy with refrigerated non-Pillsbury pizza dough. I've substituted artichoke hearts and Kalamata olives for the zucchini and onion, and next time I'll try slices of fresh figs.

very rich and delicious.

Have made several times and it's a hit every time! Rather than brushing the top with oil I simply spray the top with veg oil spray so I don't have to wash a pastry brush-lazy, I know-but it accomplishes the same task.

Very easy and very popular at the party. Used the tube rifridgerated pizza dough - was easy and tasted OK. this is a keeper because of how verstal and quick it is to make. Will use home made pizza dough next time.

This recipe is great! It's so easy but looks pretty fancy. People will think you actually did something here. It's a perfect appetizer and works well with wine.

Overall, a good recipe. I made two for a superbowl party and they got gobbled up. Read past reviews and made my own pizza dough. I used Giada's pizza dough recipe from a previous issue and it worked great. One dough made a bread that fit on a standard cookie sheet. I also did three layers of zuchini, then put a bunch of the red onion rings on top, that way you got both in every bite. Trying to put olive oil on individual red onion rings is crazy, so I put oil on the slices before breaking them up and topping the zuchini. Lastly, on the first loaf, the bottom got really brown before the veggies on top got nicely cooked, so i put the second loaf in the middle of the oven for 1/2 the time, then moved the pan to the highest rack to finish it off.

I made this for a party the other day and it was a huge hit -- people assumed I had bought it. And so easy. I'm going to experiment with other seasonal vegetables. This really is an ideal starter to serve/bring to a party.

Always a hit! I use a garlic and red pepper flake infused olive oil for the dough, which gives it extra flavor.

A wonderful appetizer. I have subsituted the pizza crust, using pillsbury puff pastry, slightly rolled out [ 1 layer ] spread alouette spread and layering yellow squash and red onion, etc. Delicious!

I use the pizza dough from a 2007 Bon Appetit. If you search "chocolate pizza" and click on the recipe for that dough you'll get it. The finished product is easy, tasty and a good way to get a dinner party started. You can make it earlier that day and just let it rise until about 25 minutes before you're ready to serve it. I'm sure it's chock full o' calories and fat thanks to the cheese.

Very tasty and a nice presentation as well. I was glad I made a test batch just for me and my husband, that way we didn't have to share it with anyone. I will be making this for my next party though!

this is really tasty. i think it will become my new go to dish for potlucks. i used chive and onion cream cheese with the parmesan, and pizza dough mix that comes in a bag and i added some italian seasoning while i mixed it. my husband loved it too.

I have made this twice for parties, I just added sliced tomatao. It recieved raves at both parties, easy to make.

This is very similar to a different recipe that I have that calls for frozen puff pastry sheets. I, too, really dislike the flavor of the canned Pillsbury dough (their products all taste exactly the same to me whether it be pizza dough, dinner rolls, bread sticks, etc.). I highly recommend using two layers of puff pastry instead for a more elegant and sophisticated presentation and taste.

I haven't made this but was curious if anyone know the calories, fat and fiber per serving?

This recipe should get 3.5 stars. It's really good and it looks impressive, like you spent hours in the kitchen making it. (In reality, the flatbread is very quick to assemble). However, like someone else mentioned, Pillsbury dough has a certain subtle flavor to it that's a giveaway. Next time I'll make my own dough or try Trader Joe's. Also, Rondelle costs an arm and a leg in the grocery store. Instead of using a pre-made herb spread, I mixed minced garlic, oregano and pepper with cream cheese and came out with basically the same thing.

Rating: 4
This recipe is great! My additions include fresh/dried oregano & parsley sprinkled on top of Alouette or Rondele' garlic & herb cream cheese spread. Rondele' now makes a soft spreadable cheese called Pub Cheese with garlic & herbs seasoning. If you wish to make it more of a main dish, chop canadian bacon & pepperoni into bite size and add inside of fold as well as on top. I added shred. mozzarella cheese on top with some freshly grated parmesan. Spray the oil on veggies as opposed to brushing it on. I also carmelized red onions in balsamic vinegar for added flavor. Enjoy!

I brought this as an appetizer to a party and everyone loved it! It was so easy to make. Whats so nice is that you can vary the ingredients. I made two and froze the second one. We just had it at dinner with our meal. Yum!

This was delicious and easy to make. Did use the Trader Joes pizza dough as suggested and used the Lite Garlic-and-Herb spread. Also, I did use some more of the parmesan as suggested. Good with soup.

mmmm... really yummy. pairs well with a light fish dish and a salad. so easy - i used a trader joe's pizza crust and had to cook it significantly longer than called for. the onions and squash browned beautifully. i also recommend really slathering the cheese inside - don't be shy! i sprinkled some extra parm-reggiano on top, too, along with freshly ground pepper.

I made this with Trader Joe's pizza dough and Borsin cheese. It was excellent. I would definitely be serving it with a fresh mixed greens salad next time a friend stops by for lunch. Easy and delicious!

This was great! Served it with a fresh salad for dinner - Loved it! Will surely make again, it's a great appetizer. Would like to try frozen pizza dough as "pillsbury" has a distinct "pillsbury" taste.

Totally simple to make and very tasty. I made it 3 times over a 2 week period when friends dropped in. I used fresh tomatoes from my garden instead of red onion. All 3 times people asked for the recipe.

Followed reviewers suggestions and added some chopped pepperoni on the inside and caramelized the onions for the top. Very good, but next time I'll make it on a preheated pizza stone so that the bottom stays crispier (hopefully) when I serve it several hours later.

This was incredibly easy and very tasty! It was filling but not too heavy. just a side note...regarding the review from the cook from "downtown Europe"...did I miss something? Some of these reviews on this website are becoming a little more like Jerry Springer and less Bon Appetit! Ex. read "chicken and mango salad with orange ginger dressing"...out of control!!!

I should have known better than to try this. The crust alone is from a can and it tasted like it.For me, this is not a keeper...

Although I rated this recipe one fork, and not one fork tine higher, I will make it again. Reading the previous three and four fork reviews, it may have been me, my new oven, or ingredients. Next time I will not double stack it hoping for a crispier crust.

I remember that one fateful day at cooking school when Chef took me aside. I knew what was coming. "You don't have to tell me," I said. "I'm out of the program, aren't I?" "Well," said Chef, "you never were really IN the program. You made that uniform you're wearing out of rags and towels, and your chef's hat is a toy space helmet. You show up to class and then either steal the knives and make us chase you to get them back, or you try to tackle people at inappropriate times." It was all true what he was saying. And yet, I thought something is brewing inside the head of this Chef. He sees something in me, some kind of raw talent that he can mold. But that's when I felt the handcuffs go on.

I made this exactly as directed except I used jumbo-sized shallots on half of the dough and the other half I left them off because some of us dislike a strong onion component in our food. This was really good, tasty, and a very pleasant change from bruchetta. It tasted better when left to sit to a luke-warm temp.

I found this far too heavy. If I were to make it again I'd 1/2 the amount of cheese, and perhaps look for another type of garlic-cheese spread rather than alouette. I'm glad to see that you are publishing recipes with some short cuts (like ready made dough) though.

Rating: 3
Very good. The zucchini slid off both sides when the crust rose in the oven, but it was easy to reposition. Let it cool slightly or you'll get that pizza burn behind your front teeth. Has anyone actually tried the mushrooms, as mentioned in several prior reviews?

The presentation was indeed lovely, but... it just didn't taste as good as I had hoped. Something about the cheese spread and the parmesan wasn't right. Maybe the parmesan I chose was of poor quality. Then again, I appear to be the only one who did not care for it, so maybe it's me! Taste did improve when it cooled down a bit.

Amazing appetizer for any occasion! I took the advice of a previous opinion and used a "light" herb and garlic spread. Also, alternated between zucchini and squash which not only added to the flavor but the colorfulness as well. Yummy!

Rating: 3
Great appetizer! I agree with the reviewer who suggested bringing the cheese to room temperature to facilite in the spreading. It's also VERY rich - I think I'll try a "light" cheese mixture next time, and will add some red pepper flakes for a little bite. Will be preparing for my Dad's 80th birthday this weekend.

I used whole wheat pizza dough with garden tomatoes, zucchini, and rosemary, which gave this sophisticated dish an earthy quality. Highly recommended.

Could not find the Alouette brand, subbed Rondele' Garlic & Herbs spreadable cheese product. Added a little dried oregano for additional flavor. Next time will use sliced mushrooms and more veggies.

Delicious! To make this more of a main dish I added bits of pepperoni & canadian bacon to the inside fold as well as the topping. Also added shredded mozzeralla to the topping. Rather than brush oil on veggies I simply used the nonstick spray (olive oil). Served with farm fresh sliced tomatoes.

This was awesome! We used less of the cheese spread and only put a layer on the bottom. It was DELICIOUS and the best part was it was easy to make. We'll definitely make this again :)

Fabulous! I skipped the parsley and salt, and caramelized the onion with balsamic vinegar before topping the crust. Truly fantastic. Next time I'm going to try a mix of white and portabella mushrooms.

I made this for an after work get together last night with cocktails and other assorted appetizers and it was a cinch to put together and absolutely delicious. Everyone wanted the recipe. I used multiple baby zucchinis and Paroma cheese instead of plain Parmesan. I'm making it again tonight!

Bring the allouette spread to room temperature first, it spreads easier. Everyone LOVED this recipe. Will be making it as an appetizer for a 50th birthday party, just cutting into bite size squares. Agree with the reviewer who used the light allouette. This is very rich but very delicious and worth every calorie.

Very good and very easy. I don't do dough well so instead I used premade thin pizza crusts( from our local italian market)and stacked them on top of each other. I think that you could use flour tortillas, less bread and carbs. Followed the recipe exactly from then on. It was delicious. No doughy hands. Liked the veggie combo but other ones would be just as delicious.

Easy recipe. Thought the garlic and herb spread did not add enough flavor on the inside. Will probably add some mozzerella, extra parm cheese and some extra herbs, maybe oregano next time. It made such a pretty presentation, will make for company next time around.

So good! I followed the recipe with the exception of fresh parsley. I used a little dry oregano instead. The Aloutte I used was the garlic & herb light. Will make again - soon!

made some changes to this recipe but it was great for a summer meal. we grilled the zucchini and onions and also grilled pizza dough. Did not fold the dough over but used the ingredients to make a great addition to a meal.
