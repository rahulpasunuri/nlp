I had the same experience as mulliner12 with the sides high but the middle collapsed. Not very pretty when placed on a plate because the squares are not uniform, with some thick and some flat. Like other reviewers, these are much too greasy for me, but my kids loved them. To each their own. If you like really dense brownies that leave your fingers greasy, you'll probably like these. Instead of the semisweet chocolate chips, I used white chocolate chips, as suggested, and think that was a good change.

I baked it last Saturday with 50% reduction in sugar. It still too sweet for my taste. However, everybody else love it.

These brownies are always, always a hit. Just make sure you toast the nuts. I recommend bittersweet chips, too.

My oven is pretty reliable -- I end up cooking most things as long as the recipe recommends. This recipe said 30 to 35 minutes, and I baked them for at least 45 minutes. The top was thoroughly browned, but a toothpick didn't come out quite clean. I've found in that past that you don't want to bake brownies until the center is completely done, and the top and edges looked on the verge of burning, so I took them out. The sides had set and stayed tall, but the center collapsed. It was tasty, but still too thin and greasy for my taste. It could be that cooking longer works, or just that some people like that very moist quality.

I took cwayland from Charlotte's suggestion and used white chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet...a true blondie! Not at all greasy, very moist & quite delish! I couldn't find white chocolate in any of my usual haunts (I think that everybody's still wiped out from the holiday) so I used the Trader Joe's White Chocolate Baking Bits...pretty darned tasty!

I make at least 6 batches of these every year for Christmas gifts and people beg for the recipe. I omit the semi-sweet chips. I like the true blondie look of these brownies. You can cut them small because of the richness.

I made these along with all the other luscious brownies featured in Gourmet 1996 Christmas edition. They were unforgettable and I'm still famous for them. I always try new recipes - but these were so amazing I have had to repeat. almost 12 years later they are still too good to be true. (follow recipe exactly, this would be only reason for unfavorable reviewers)

This is my second review (the 1st is directly below). I brought a chocolate chip version and a version with chopped white chocolate (instead of the semi-sweet chips) to work. They were both quickly devoured. My main issue is that people thought the chocolate chip version was a really good tollhouse bar. They had no idea there was white chocolate in it. This seems like a waste given the cost of the Lindt chocolate I used. Also, I thought the white chocolate version was much better the next day. It did not seem as greasy. I would probably make the version with chopped white chocolate again.

I found that the chocolate chips overpowered the white chocolate. Tasted like greasy chocolate chip cookies. I made a second batch and used chopped white chocolate in place of the semi-sweet. It was much better. I also found both batches to be too greasy for my tastes. Finally, like a previous reviewer, I had problems with the top browning too much. I recommend covering the top with foil 1/2 through cooking.

One of the best brownie recipes I've come across, I think it is great for both brownie and white chocolate lovers.

Made these for a summer bbq and got rave reviews---even though my 2 yr old turned the oven off 1/2 way through baking and I had to guess at how long they'd baked--very forgiving! Making again today for 4th of July by request

These were absolutely delicious! I doubled the recipe to bring to a family reunion and people kept going back for seconds. They are very rich, but addicting. I used Ghiradelli chocolate, and didn't have a problem with it melting. Followed the recipe exactly and they came out great. Will definitely do again!

I made these to include on a New Year's Eve buffet. With 25 guests, I didn't hear one comment about the brownies nor did I care for them myself. I'm a huge white chocolate & macadamia fan so I'm not sure why these were such a huge disappointment. They had NO flavor!

I've made these brownies several times. Every time I make them, I get rave reviews and requests for more. Personally I find them to be slightly too rich, but I seem to be the only one. Since I like thick, chewy brownies, I double the recipe and use the tiny semi-sweet chips. It makes the darker chocolate less powerful and they turn out prettier. If you double this one, be careful with the cooking time because it gets tricky. With my oven, it takes about 45 minutes.

Tasty brownies for white chocolate lovers. I made them with milk chocolate chips for a sweeter, more mellow brownie. I would suggest underbaking these a bit for those who like a more chewy brownie. Also, letting the brownies completely cool on a rack and then refrigerating them for awhile before cutting will help stop the reported crumbling effect.

This is a VERY good and unique brownie recipe. I thought that the semi-sweet chocolate chips did not combine well with this delicate-flavored brownie. Next time I will use half white chocolate chips and half dried cranberries plumped in rum (the colors should be lovely for Christmas). Also, I will cover the brownies with foil for the first 15 minutes or so as they got a bit too brown for "white chocolate brownies".

If your mouth waters equally at the thought of white chocolate and macadamia nuts, and darker chocolates and other nuts, this recipe is for you. I made these brownies for the 4th of July and frosted them with a frosting of confectioners sugar, unsalted, sweet butter, melted white chocolate, vanilla and a tablespoon or so of hot water, topped with red, white and blue star sugar decorations from my local kitchen shop. Delicious!

I just made these brownies and haven't gotten the "group" feedback yet. I tried one and liked it, the only problem I have is that the top was very crusty; when I cut them it sort of crumbled (there was air under the crust)...anyone else run into this?

Everybody loved these and raved about them. In fact, a bunch of my friends are planning a cooking get-together this weekend so I can show everyone how to make them.

These are delicious, but be sure you are using good quality white chocolate. I used Ghiradelli the first time, and it was almost impossible to melt and has a very vanilla flavor to it. I used a better quality one the next time and they were even better.

Made these twice, because the first time they were a bit dry. Second time they were better, but not sure if I'd do again.

These are wonderful! They won raves when I brought them to a picnic recently with friends.

DELICIOUS AND EASY TO PREPARE AND I SHARED THE FRUITS OF MY KITCHEN WITH A CLIENT OF MINE WHO NEEDED EXTRA CALORIES AND SHE SIMPLY INHALED THEM
