This was a tasty, simple meal. I sliced the beef prior to cooking and then added it back to the sauce to keep warm while the egg noodles finished up. Next time I will only use a teaspoon of dijon, because it was overpowering.

This is a winning recipe. You know it's good when your family continues to compliment you throughout the night even when dinner is long over. The only change I made was I substituted creme fraiche for the whipping cream and added a little cornstarch to the broth. The sauce was as smooth as velvet, not runny, and the taste was delicious. These two changes, I believe, made all the difference.

This is a favorite in our house. I made a few minor changes. I cubed the beef and browned it in olive oil with lots of ground pepper. I then followed the recipe but used non fat sour cream instead of cream. I put the browned beef into the sauce and mushroom mix and let it thicken (option - thicken by mixing broth with corn starch in a cup and then stir into the pan) then serve in a bowl over the noodles. Great, fast and simple!

Excellent recipe! The only thing I did differently was to cut the beef (I used NY strip) into 2" pieces about 1/4" thick. I browned them and followed the rest of the recipe exactly, then added in the beef pieces to the sauce at the end. Wonderful and very comforting -- great dish for a cold night!

Very little flavor. Nothing special. I was looking for a recipe to use my left over beef tenderloin and thought this sounded tasty. I followed the recipe, except for using tasty leftover beef and the sauce was very thin and tasteless.

This was super! Of course I had to change it up in order to reflect what I had in the house...but I'm a cook not a chef so there you go. I used venison instead of beef and a bit of pork for the fat content. I sliced it beforehand and used more pepper than called for. I followed another reviewer's suggestions of cornstarch and added more mustard, cream and white wine (instead of brandy). Didn't have egg noodles so I used penne as that was what I did have. Kids really liked it. It certainly isn't fancy but it sure is flavourful.

The sauce was pretty tasteless. My kids liked it but they like plain mac and cheese too.

Really good, really quick and easy too. I followed the instructions for the most part. I cubed the beef instead of sliced it and used sizzler steaks. No brandy in the house, so I used cooking wine. Oh, and used half & half as that was what was in the house too. I had this made in 30 minutes and it was a great change up from the normal menu. I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty decent for a very, very quick meal. No mushrooms at all but I did use a shallot. I was thinking that it would be nice with asparagus or artichoke. But, after an extremely hard day, with nothing but what was in the fridge and freezer, this worked nicely.

Rating: 4
CORRECTION: I added 1 whole shallot NOT a Scallion!

Rating: 4
I also added garlic, 1 whole scallion and used cornstarch to thicken. I recommend doubling the sauce as well. I used the beef tenderloin and it was delicious. Love the pepper crust on it. Adds texture to the meal.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorites. The flavor is great and I didn't make a single change to it. Using the tenderloin is deluxe but you can switch to a less cut, and it's still good.

I made this for our dinner club and other than doubling the sauce, I didn't change a thing. It's a very simple yet elegant dish and worthy of company!

This was a great dish!...added 2 cloves of garlic and sliced black olives for the mushrooms (spouse is mushroom free). Will make again, maybe add shallot as said in a earlier review.

Rating: 3
I made this last night and it was very good. I did make some modifications. I added a whole shallot and three cloves of garlic with the mushrooms. I also used Zinfindel instead of brandy and put about three tablespoons and next time I make it, will probably add even more. I also added somewhere between one and two tablespoons of cornstarch while boiling towards the end to give it a thicker of a gravy. My boyfriend put me up to a stroganoff challenge and he was very pleased with the results. I also used a cheaper cut of beef and it worked just fine.

Very good, and pretty simple to make. I replaced the beef with thinly sliced pork, and added sliced green peppers to the sauce. Delicious and very filling!

I deglazed the pan used for the steak with just a bit of red wine, then added everything else (beef broth, cream, etc. and the pastas). Simple but effective!

It was really runny with not a lot of taste. The whole family was disappointed.

I probably use more pepper than called for, as I do make a nice peppered crust. This is a fast, week-night hit in our house. YUM!

Excellent dish! Agreed with other reviewers that sauce was too runny. I used reduced fat sour cream in place of the whipping cream and added some corn starch for thickening. Served it with spinach salad with strawberry vinagrette from this website and it made a great meal.

I used this recipe for some left over prime rib roast. My family loved it! I liked the mustard in this recipe (it was not too overwhelming). I didn't have Cognac or Brandy so substituted with dark rum and a pinch of sugar.

Rating: 4
I don't think I want to make traditional stroganoff again! I served this for 5 of us and just had a bigger tenderloin. I think next time (oh there will be many more times..)I will add more criminis and make some additional sauce for who ever wishes more.

Rating: 4
This dish is spectacular. I've made it twice, once for two and once for twelve, and although it lends itself nicely to modifications, I wouldn't change a thing. I can't imagine how those who gave one fork got to that place but I'm sorry for them. Served with grilled fresh asparagus and am still getting rave reviews!

Any reasonable brandy should do in lieu of cognac.

Does anyone have suggestions on what is best to use if I do not have Cognac?

Quick and easy. I used a cheap roast, cut into cubes instead of tenderloin to cut down costs. And I substituted low-fat sour cream for whipping cream to cut down on fat and calories. Added an onion and 2 cloves of garlic. Boiled down the beef stock to make a thick, tasty gravy. Served with a simple spinach side salad. Delicious!

I have made this dish quite often. It's very good and a little higer class for a quick dinner. Very good and tasty. Others I have made it for and given the recipe also like it.

I thought this recipe was great. I may have over salted the beef before I cooked it, but otherwise it was good. I used spicy brown mustard instead of dijon, but it still tasted good. Next time I will use dijon and less salt. Will make it again.

simple, followed it to the letter with the exception of giving those steaks a sensual olive-oil-poivre-sel rubdown before the sizzling skillet... next time I'll reduce that sexy silky sauce some more because it was on the runny side. Wait till it's sufficiently reduced to start the pasta instead of heeding the "meanwhile" instruction. scintillating...

I thought this was simply fabulous. My whole family was in awe. I didn't have any cognac so I used some dry marsala instead but that was the only change I made. I will definitely make this again.

My family LOVED this, even my kids ages 7 and 9! It did take much longer to prepare, in part because I let the sauce simmer for 1/2 hour+ to thicken. It would have been so runny, otherwise. I doubled the recipe and followed it exactly, with the following additions: prior to cooking the mushrooms, I sauteed 4 HUGE shallots and 4 cloves of garlic, all minced. I also wisked in 1/3 cup of sour cream at the end. Its a keeper!

Rating: 3
I read the reviews before I made this, and based some of my changes on what others have said, and increased the amount of sauce. With all of the changes, it came out really good. I gave it three forks because it probably wouldn't have been so good if I followed the recipe to the letter. I used 1 lb. thinly sliced top sirloin, used about 5 oz. mushrooms instead of 8, and cooked a teaspoon of minced garlic along with them. For the sauce, I used: 2 cups beef broth, 2 tbsp Sherry (in place of the cognac), replaced the whipping cream with 2 tbsp butter, 1/4 cup whole milk, and 2 tbsp cornstarch. I made 12 oz. egg noodles, and used 3 tsp dried parsley instead of fresh.

I made this recipe for my boyfriend and we both really enjoyed it. I didn't have cognac so I used a splash of red wine instead, I also added some chives to the egg noodles and used half and half instead of whipping cream. Very delciious and easy to make!

My husband doesn't like mushrooms or mustard, but he loved this! I used a thick New York strip instead, and didn't have any cognac, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I think the sauce is fine as is, especially if you're using a homemade-style egg noodle.

Very tasty. Family enjoyed the meal, but would use sour cream instead of whipping cream when I make this again.

Rating: 3
I wasn't in the mood to spend $25-30 on filets, so I used some small top sirloin steaks. I think this makes it a good weeknight dinner recipe and the steak is very flavorful. The sauce does need some type of thickening agent...will probably do a little butter/flour next time. Will also play with adding onion and garlic. Overall very pleased with this dish and will make again. But I don't think I'd ever use expensive tenderloin steaks for this.

This is very good, I used sherry, added garlic and onion,to thicken sauce I added (1tbsp butter and 1tbsp flour mixed first) then added it to the sauce. Did not use the whipping cream.

Excellent flavor and very quick.I can see where the addition of shallots or onions would be nice. Next time I will double the sauce. The mustard is what makes this sauce unique and special.

made this for guests and although they did not think it was a real 'stroganoff' they enjoyed. I used a spicy brown mustard, did not have Dijon on hand. sauce was skimpy for all of us, would make larger amount next time.

in all, this recipe was pretty good, pretty quick and pretty easy. i some of presliced beef (you know, it's sold as "Great for Stir-Fry!"), sauteed half a grated onion with the mushrooms, and added a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce. In all, it's a pretty flexible recipe. Don't have cognac or brandy on hand? Use sherry, or even white wine.

i made this last night and thought it was delicious. the tenderloin is a perfect cut of beef instead of the typical tough beef tips. i did thicken the sauce with cornstarch because it seemed watery otherwise.

who said that this is "Beef Stroganoff"? Stroganoff would turned in his grave if he could see and taste this... Look in old (before 1917) Russian cookbooks!!!!

I made this for dinner last night and it was quite good. After seeing other reviewers' suggestions I added shallots and garlic. I also stirred about 1 tbsp of corn starch into the beef broth to thicken the sauce. I had the leftovers for lunch today and it tasted even better.

Things were good until mixing in the mustard to the cream sauce. Mustard has vinegar so my sauce curdled. perhaps the sauce was still too hot and hence the curdling, nonetheless, it was rather gross.

Wow... just, WOW. Though I baked a lot when I was younger, I just started cooking full meals about a year ago. This is my first that I thought rivaled some of my favorite upper-mid-range SF restaurants. So, so, SO good. Rather than noodles, I served the beef & mushroom sauce over roasted garlic mashed potatoes and plated it with a side of steamed buttered broccolini. Awesome meal; astoundingly good for the amount of work.
