This pie was incredible! I made it as printed and the guests couldn't stop raving about it. They insisted on keeping all leftovers and promised to return the pie plate (clean). I used almond paste which made the topping a little wetter than it probably should have been, but it baked up perfectly and the taste was awesome! I will make this many times over! Thank you!

Followed recipe exactly (except used my usual all butter crust) and got RAVE reviews. My uncle requested I make a blueberry pie for his birthday party, and he was thrilled with this one. My husband keeps bringing the pie up in conversation, so perhaps we'll be making another one soon!

I make this every year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Everyone absolutely adores this pie! For the filling I use a little less cornstarch and add vanilla and almond extracts. For the topping I use a full 7oz tube of almond paste (we love our almond paste) and also add lemon zest and vanilla bean. In the last 10 minutes of baking I sprinkle on some almond slivers which is great texture wise! You have got to make this pie, the creamy almond topping and sweet blueberry filling go together perfectly!

The BEST blueberry pie recipe hands down. Making it for Thanks giving. Everytime I have made it, my guests claim it's the best they ever had. I add some organic blueberry flavor extract to the filling. I use a whole package of almond paste.(more than the 4oz.)

Using 6 1/2C Michigan blueberries, I made 2 pies in regular sized Pet Ritz pie shells & it only bubbled over a bit. I cut the sugar back to 1/2C as the berries were really sweet...but I used the 1/4C cornstarch...added a bit more lemon & abt. 1 tsp. zest. For topping I used almond paste and a few sliced almonds that I put in the food processor, along with the other items. The topping recipe made enough to cover both pies. Folks raved abt. this pie & I loved it as well...definitely will make again. Don't put it in the fridge...and, it tastes best the 1st day.

Overall a great pie. I followed the recipe, with the exception of adding lemon zest with the lemon juice. The filling had nice blueberry taste - not too sweet or "jammy" and SO easy. My only concern was that the topping was a little sandy. Maybe I over processed the marzipan & butter, but I ended up just adding in some crushed almonds for more texture and it was great!

Filling is delicious, although mine was runny, I think I failed on the cornstarch amount. I used fresh blueberries and could have cut back on sugar. The lemon juice is essential, fabulous background flavor. I would follow others and start at 425 for 15 and finish at 375. An absolute "save".

I never made any pie in my life, so this was a challenge. It was nevertheless a big hit and recommendable to everybody. The only thing which was not clear is how thick the crust should be. We made it 1/5" and that appeared to be a little to thin to hold the inside. Can anyone tell me? The filling is actually pretty liquid, but someone told me pies like this supposed to be this way. but anyway, even with no experience, this is delicious!

I wasn't sure about this recipe when I read that the blueberry filling had to be cooked ahead of time with all that cornstarch but it was fabulous. Of course, you have to have good blueberries because that makes all the difference in the world. I didn't have marzipan, unfortunately, so I subbed in some chopped walnuts and added a little sugar to the topping. Delicious!

I made the recipe exactly as instructed except for the cooking time. This was easy and delicious. If I had cooked it for 50 minutes, though, the topping and crust would have been way too brown - 40 min. worked for me.

my crumble, portions according to the reipe, sank into the blueberry filling while baking. Did that happen to anyone else? In the end I had to bake more topping separately and layer it on top after the filling cooled and thickened. Thanks to reviewers for recommending more topping. Also I baked it at 400F for about 40 min and the filling (frozen bluberries) worked out fine. I would reduce the sugar too. I made the mistake of tasting the blueberry filling while cooking it on the stove, thinking it was not sweet enough and adding more. At the end, the blueberry filling became much too sweet. I added a lot more lemon juice and even then, could only taste a tinge.

This pie was an absolute hit at a bbq yesterday. I continue to get emails raving about it. The funny thing was, in my opinion, it deserved a B, maybe a B+; but my guests apparently disagree.

excellent, easy recipe and a good way to use summer berries. I made it as a crumble (no pie crust) and doubled the amount of topping as some reviews suggested, but it was a bit too much. definitely check the pie frequently to prevent the topping from burning. I added some lemon zest to the berries, and some cinnamon & cardamom to the topping. The combination of lemony berries and almondy topping was fantastic.

I have made this pie at least 4 times. I always double the topping recipe because the first time I made it, it didn't seem like there was enough to adequately cover the pie. I have always used fresh berries. It is always a hit!

I altered this recipe a lot. But, the dish was so delicious, I thought I would share! I used fresh blueberries instead of frozen wild blueberries. And in an effort to make this a healthier dessert, reducing calories and fat, I did not include the pie crust. I turned it into a crisp. But it is the best crisp I have made yet! I grated the zest of a lemon adding that and the lemon juice to the blueberries, along with about 2-3 tbls high quality maple syrup. Allowing that to marinate, I made the topping. Instead of the almond paste, I used about a cup of raw sliced almonds. I substituted all purpose flour with whole wheat pastry flour, and did use all of the butter called for. Then I poured the blueberries and all the liquid into a deep pie dish, layered a single very ripe banana's slices on top, then added the crisp topping evenly on top of that. Incredible! The banana added a creaminess to the dish that was glorious. All those almond slivers were really tasty. I will make this again for sure. I do want to try making the pie crust with whole wheat flour and add that next time.

This was absolutely wonderful. I made it for a dinner party with 8 people total and we ate the whole thing! I used fresh beautiful large regular blueberries. One of my guests said it was the best pie of any kind that she had ever eaten! I was really happy that it wasn't too sweet. I'm making it again for a July 4 party. I'm sure it will be a big hit.

I have made this pie twice and both times everyone simply raved about it. I found that almond paste is better than marzipan and I added a bit more cornstarch to make sure it wasn't too runny. Jasper Wyman frozen Maine blueberries work great. You will be the hit of the party if you make this pie.

This is a delicious dish! This is the first blueberry pie I've every made and it turned out wonderful the very first time I made it. I used a mixture of fresh and frozen blueberries. Pre-cooking it on the stove gave the pie a nice thickness to. The almond flavor added just an extra twist to keep it interesting. Will definitely make again.

Although 2 forks doesn't seem good-it says that is what it represents-the pie is good but not great-the topping didn't crumble very well as it was a lot of butter and almond paste which made it more smooth-the crust also got too brown-as others had also stated-think there are better recipes out there

Best blueberry pie I ever made. Since almond paste comes in 7 oz. tubes, I just used the whole tube and added a little more flour and butter to balance out the crumb topping ratios. Umm Umm Good. The blueberries I used were the bonafide real Alaska wild blueberries.

I don't understand where I went wrong! I am an experienced baker and I followed the recipe to the letter to make the filling and it did not thicken. Couldn't make the pie, ended up using the filling over ice cream.

This recipe may result in a marriage proposal--I've never seen my boyfriend so happy to eat one of my desserts! My only suggestion would be to either cover the pie during baking--I had to lower the temperature about halfway through to prevent the crust from getting too brown.

This pie was excellent! I don't like overly sweet desserts. This was a perfect balance of sweet and tart - the topping added a nice crunch.

Well, I broke my own rule of not making something as written, FIRST...then modifying. I followed the recipe exactly except that I listened to other reviewers suggestions to increase the amount of almond paste. I used seven ounces. It was way too much. Too overpowering. Regardless, I thought the pie was good, but not great.

Rating: 4
This pie was excellent. You should probably adjust the sugar depending on the sweetness of your blueberries. I used some nice tart blueberries from the farmers market and used just shy of 3/4 cup sugar. I thought it was nicely balanced.

The absolute best blueberry pie I have ever made. I was a bit skeptical about cooking the berries first before baking but when serving the pie and it did not flood all over the plate, I knew I was on to something. Based on other reviews I used almond paste rather than marzipan and actually doubled the amount of almond paste and also added 1/2 cup of sliced almonds into the food processor as well. The pie was devoured by a group of "non-dessert eaters" with requests for the recipe.

Rating: 4
Great recipe...recommend using only about 1/3 cup of sugar for the filling, otherwise the sugar overpowers the natural flavors of the blueberry and the subtlety of the almond topping...also, cooked at 400 for 15 minutes and then covered with foil for additional ~40 minutes @ 375 and it came out perfect.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it! First pie I have baked! As others have suggested, I would grind extra almonds in the topping and make extra to add more on the top. It also seemed to brown quickly so, I had to cover with foil about half way into it.

I come from Maine, where wild blueberry pie is a state past- time. I chose this recipe because I liked the uniqueness of the topping, but I felt like it was overpowered by the blueberry filling. I'll make it again but probably use almond paste instead of marzipan and increase the amount used.

I made this recipe because of the high rating but can't give it a good review. I guess I didn't register the part about the shorter baking time because 50" was definitely far too long. I made more of the almond crumble, as suggested, but it didn't taste like anything - especially because it ended up too dark. Even when it was raw, I didn't like the taste of it and felt 1/2 tsp. salt is far too much. It really tasted salty. Another problem was probably the blueberries. We have blueberry farms around the city but this year the weather was bad and has really affected the taste of the berries. They practically have no taste. Having said that, nobody in my family liked the filling and the comments were that it was too sweet and "gluey" because of all the cooking beforehand in cornstarch. I made the "Best Ever Pie Crust" but it wasn't enough to save this pie. This was a lot of work for nothing.

This pie is plate-licking good-I've already made it twice in one week. The baking instructions are definitely off as others have noted. We changed the baking to 425 for 15 minutes, then reduced the heat to 375 and baked it an additional 35-40 minutes. Cover the center with foil if it is getting too brown. Also, adding cinnamon to both the filling and topping is a good idea.

I used a pre-made, frozen pie crust and frozen blueberries but followed the directions for the filling and topping to the letter and served it warm with vanilla ice cream. Everyone liked it and I will make it again. My one suggestion is that I would suggest using more marzipan, maybe 6 oz. as I felt the 4oz. kind of got lost among the other flavors. The next time I make this, I might try adding a few chopped almonds to the food processor when making the topping.

Really 3.5 forks. This pie is very good, although excepting the almond topping, it's not really very different from my usual blueberry pie. In fact, I think the almond flavor doesn't quite stand up to the blueberries, a problem given the cost of almond past compared to usual crumb- topping ingredients. Next time I might try a little almond extract, as I do like the flavor combination. I do suggest the following modifications: (1.) As I suspected, it's not necessary to cook the filling prior to baking the pie. I put the berries right in the crust raw and baked. Blueberries cook quickly. This saves a lot of time and mess. 1/4 cup of dry tapioca at the bottom of the pie before adding the filling keeps it from being too liquidy. (2.) I like my pies not too sweet, as it hides the flavor of the fruit. I cut the sugar content down to 1/2 cup and probably could have gone further. This is just a matter of preference. (3.) I added a handful of oats to the crumb topping mixture to give some additional texture.

Delicious! Everyone LOVED this pie, except for the crust. Next time I make it, I'll use a different crust recipe. I didn't have fresh blueberries, but the frozen ones worked perfectly. I also found that canned almond paste is less expensive than the tube and easier to use. Definitely cover the edges of the crust after it has browned! I tried the crumb topping on a cherry pie as well, and it was excellent!

Rating: 3
Wonderful flavor but I had a problem with the crust. It was very crumbly and I ended up having to pat it in place in the pie plate. I figured out that I had not added enough ice water. Also cooking it at 400 degrees for the whole time made the crust and topping very brown. But everyone at our cookout loved the pie and I had no leftovers

Made this for Sunday dinner. I prepared the filling, topping and crust on Saturday and refrigerated them, then put the pie together Sunday morning and baked it. Everything was very easy to prepare and it turned out fantastic. The filling is abundant and the crumble topping gives it that extra something. A super easy way to wow your guests!

Amazing! I made this for a dinner party last night and it went down a treat. The crust is delicious and very easy to work with. I like the idea of adding cinnamon and almonds to the topping and will try that the next time I make it. I used fresh blueberries in the pie. Yum!

Outstanding. I served this to many people and we couldnt get enough of it. The almond paste is pricey, as well as the blueberries, but totally worth the cost. The almond flavor in the top was just perfect. Be sure to cover the edges of the pie with foil since you cook it at 400 the entire time.

Fantastic! This is very similar to an outstanding Blueberry-Lavender Tart that I had at the Lopez Bay Cafe on Lopez Island, WA, and I modified this recipe based on that one, by using lavender sugar in the blueberries. The thing I loved about this recipe is that even though I used frozen berries, I think because they were cooked before baking, the filling didn't run all over. I did my topping more in clumps than crumbles, which made it harder to cut, but otherwise this pie sliced and served beautifully. I also used an all butter pie-crust, rather than the 1/2 shortening called for in this recipe, and it worked perectly with the filling.
