The Orthodox and Christian Easters were the same date this year so I prepared a Greek Easter Dinner menu. Tripled this recipe and it was a huge hit. The feta and fresh mint complimented the blandness of the zucchini pulp,all of our guests raved about this dish. And, I made it a day ahead and just reheated it on Easter afternoon. A keeper! B.J.

I made this 3 times this summer, once ahead of time and then popped under the broiler when we were ready to eat. Very good.

This is a delicious, attractive accompaniment to grilled summer meals. It's always a hit - try it with salmon. Consider sauteeing the filler veggies in batches - my biggest fry pan gets too crowded and the zucchini steams rather than browns. And chop the filling slices, to hasten the sauteeing time.

I really liked this - a new way to prepare zucchini. I used "baseball" zuchs that I got from my CSA, and they looked great all scooped out. I used dried dill since I didn't have fresh, and used the suggestions from original reviewer regarding nuking and not using extra zuchs and it turned out great.

I followed the suggestions of those cooks before me and didn't use the 2 extra zucs. It turned out wonderfully. I served it with chicken. Definitely a keeper.

This recipie has a great mix of flavors. Next time I make it, I will add plenty of salt and more Feta

No need to use extra zuchs for stuffing. No need to mess up a blender or steamer either. Zap the scooped zuch halves in a microwave 2-3 minutes. Saute onions and then the scooped out contents of shell. Add crumbled feta and dill and stir. Broil as indicated. Yummy and very easy. (recipe halves well - With two people I needed only one zuch.)

This is a really good side dish for chicken or fish. My husband who does not really like dill thought the combination of the onions, feta and dill were pleasant. I also agree that you do not need the two extra zucchini for stuffing.

We made this as a side dish at a dinner party. The general consensus was that, while we all liked the idea, we hated it in execution. We particularly disliked the filling. A warning for those who do choose to make this dish -- do not overblend the filling ingredients (and no, the additional two zucchini to stuff are not necessary. We had entirely too much filling).

Very pretty and delicious. I served this for dinner tonight as a complement to spaghetti with tomato sauce. Wonderful. I microwaved the boats for 3 minutes rather than steaming them, otherwise I prepared the dish as per the recipe. The zucchinis may have been larger than 1/2 pound - 1/2 of a zucchini per person (about 1 1/2" in diameter) seemed to be plenty as a side dish - and with the addition of onion and cheese, they didn't require the additional two zucchinis as stuffing. So good.

This was an easy, simple and delicious way for me to use up an abundance of feta. I will certainly be making this one again, and especially to entertain my many veggie friends.

I tried this as yet another chance to use up our summertime surplus of zucchini! It was quite good. I did use garlic/herb feta (I had it in the house), and omitted the dill (I didn't have that!), and will try it again as written. It lacked the "zip" that I was expecting, but my 8 year old loved the "filling", and my 9 year old ate all the shells that she emptied. What more can you ask?
