It's amazing to me that something with such modest and limited ingredients could be so good. I have made this twice on the grill by nestling my dutch oven into warm coals and braising for hours. Very simple, doesn't heat up the kitchen, and really delicious. I also add a splash of cider vinegar but like it either way.

Rating: 3
I have made this several times and it is always very good. If I do not have cider, I have used apple juice and/or apple cider vinegar.

Rating: 4
I either make this slowly braised in oven as written or in crockpot (at which time I remove meat to make sauce). I keep some onions out until last hour so they have a bit more form as they will melt into the sauce. Also add bit more cider and some calvados (or any apple brandy) to finish off the sauce, using it to deglaze pan then boil down). Fresh sage is good with this as well. This is also good made into little pot pie type servings, i.e. fill into prebaked tart shells and top with crust then bake into top crust is golden.

Added a little aged balsamic vinegar to the onions. Used unfiltered apple juice instead of cider. First time I made it and turned out perfect. So simple and best tasting braised pork ever!

This was my first time to ever buy and cook pork shoulder - I followed this recipe as documented except for temp and time - starting at 300 for 1 hour and reducing to 275 for 2.5 hours. While pulling pork apart, I eliminated as much fat as possible. Loved the taste! Two days later, reheated pork and served it wrapped in homemade crepes - cooking the crepe batter in garlic butter. Wow - what an incredible combination! I love it when experiments work.

I've made this every fall for 3 years, and each time I think I like it better. I do add 3 sliced apples to the onions under the pork, then I just puree everything to make the sauce. Comes out beautifully every time.

Great way to cook this cut of meat - amazingly tender. Tripled the amount of garlic and added a diced apple to the sauce while it reduced. Lots of leftovers that were even more tasty.

Rating: 4
This recipe is outstanding, especially for how few ingredients there are and how little work is involved. My shoulder was almost 5 lbs so I used 1 cup of cider and 1/4 c of ACV. I also seasoned the meat a day in advance, cooked the dish the night before to make skimming the fat easier, and rewarmed for a hour and let the fatty side crisp up before serving. Helps to have good quality pork from a local farm. My dinner guests raved.

I made the recipe as written except substituted apple cider vinegar for 1/4 cup of the apple cider (per suggestion by the previous reviewer). Also, I used pork shanks instead of pork shoulder. This was a great braising recipe with a rich, slightly sweet, pan sauce. I'll definitely make it again using either pork shoulder or pork shanks.

I misread the ingredients and used apple cider vinegar instead of cider. The result was divine! Since I didn't make the original recipe I have no way of comparing but everyone tasting the pork with the vinegar sauce said it was the best pork dish they had ever eaten.

Made exactly as per recipe. Very easy, but at the end my liquid for sauce was mostly fat. I strained off the fat and added about 1/2 cup cider and 1/2 cup water to the onions and reduced. I also put the meat under the broiler to really crisp the skin. It was sublime.

Very good. I added a few quartered apples, Granny Smith, and a few sprigs of thyme. The pork was juicy and tender. The apples cooked down and made a nice thickener for the gravy. What a great no fuss recipe.

My husband made this as per the recipe. It was good but the sauce is a must as the braised meat wants to be dry. I served with boiled potatoes & that worked. Pull the leftovers & serve warm with the sauce as a sandwich!

excellent flavor with the apples and onions, but make sure to salt well, or the inner meat won't have much flavor.

FANTASTIC recipe - super moist, super tender pork in a delicious saucey braising liquid that will make your house smell great. I made this with an entire head of garlic (6-8 cloves), and let the shoulder rest overnight with the salt/pepper/garlic rub.

Rating: 4
I made the dish exactly as written. It was just fantastic. Don't add extra liquid, I promise. The onions and pork release a ton of juices. I also did not see the need to add any apple to it, though it wouldn't taste bad. The 'gravy' has a subtle flavour that would be made quite obvious with apple. I served the dish with potato gnocchi and sauteed broccoli rabe. Yummo.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! I added toasted and ground coriander and fennel seeds. I also used 1/2 cup of wheat beer with the cider. get yourself a bottle of red wine to drink and don't forget to pair with some other earthy-flavored side dishes. We had sauteed lemon kale and roasted beets. Divine!

Rating: 4
A wonderful simple dish for the fall. Using high quality pork (heritage and/or free-range) makes a huge difference in such a straightforward preparation. To feed a crowd, I used one shoulder roast from a local free-range farm and another from Safeway (cost considerations, you know), and the difference in flavor was incredible.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fantastic! I used a 4.75lb pork butt and adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. I followed other reviewers and added some dried thyme and rosemary when I added the cider. When reducing the liquid at the end I added one chopped apple. I refrigerated it overnight so I could easily skim the fat off. What a delicious recipe and so easy to make. Very little hands on time for such a tasty dish. This one is a keeper!

wow, I'd give more forks if I could. It's amazing that such few ingredients can make such delicious meal. As per suggestion, I added an apple and pureed the sauce. I put a pinch of rosemary and thyme. I couldn't find unfiltered cider, so I got sparkling from tj's. Cooked per recipe for 2 hours, then removed the meat and let it stand alone in the oven for 20 mins, last 10 mins put the broiler on high to crisp up the skin. Next time I will leave it under the broiler a little longer. Yummy!

Easy, My whole family liked. I added thyme & rosemary to the salt & pepper on the roast. Added apple to the juice. Used an Immersion Blender to make the sauce smooth.

followed as written. very simple and tasty...however one question. how am i supposed to 'reduce' 3/4 cup of cider to 2-3 cups (after it's been simmering for 3 hrs) as indicated in the recipe? did they write the wrong amount of cider to start with?

Rating: 4
I must add my voice to the chorus of 4 stars here. Followed recipe except for dry rub marinade of S&P and poultry seasoning for five hours prior to braise and, per previous reviewer, added two sliced, unpeeled apples with the onion saute, which turned to mash and thickened the sauce. You can't go wrong. One of the best pork shoulders I ever made.

This dish was delicious! We didn't alter the recipe at all. Cooked exactly to the letter. Meat was melt in your mouth tender and the onions and cider sauce was wonderful! I think we can tweak it a bit to enhance the flavors, but as of right now, this is my new favorite pork dish. :)

I dont give 4 forks easily, but as an avid pork lover, this was the bomb! Very similar to one I do in winter, but I used the pork butt because of fat to meat ratio. After meat had cooked for 3 hours or so, I sliced it into big chunks and put it back in the pot. Kept lid off and reduced the cider/onion/apple mixture in the oven for about another half hour(yes, apples are a plus)instead of on stove top. Our guests ate with great gusto! Served over wide noodles and with homemade apple sauce and steamed broccoli. Enjoy with a Pinot Noir and you are all set.

Like others, I used a bone-in pork butt that I had gotten on sale, added some diced apples (4 fugi) to the onions and used powder garlic instead of garlic cloves and some dried thyme on the roast and in the onion apple saute before I deglased w/ the cider. This was truly delicious. Good w/ egg noodles and pickled red cabbage.

I had a large boneless Boston Butt from the farmer's market. I inserted garlic slivers, scored the skin and then rubbed the meat with salt, pepper and thyme. I browned and did the onions and cider the night before and then fridged it over night. Next day, just slow cooked it. Dinner was awesome! Served the left over meat pulled to chunks in heated gravey over egg noodles. Wow. Two winners one easy recipe.

Used recipe as a base line for my own variation. Cook time, ingredient measurements then substitute with my own ingredients. For example, insert with clove & rub with chinese five spice, or use mesquite seasoning & BBQ sauce. Very easy, inexpensive, and efficient leftovers.

This recipe has become a family favorite. I use pork shoulder and pork butt, depending on which is available. I do remove a good bit of skin and fat before browning since it does make it harder to eat the next day if it's covered in pig- leather. I actually add chopped, peeled apples when I have them. I had done this on about the 10th time I made it simply because I had apples in the fridge that needed to be eaten. It thickened the liquid and added another dimension of apple flavor, and I've added them each time since. I don't cut slits into the meat and stick the sliced garlic in them since I notice no difference in flavor. I've served this over egg noodles, rice, and even cornbread. You just can't go wrong with it, and you can always play around with the recipe to experiment, and it doesn't ruin anything.

To Lauka--- Excellent transition to BBQ---use the onions, 1 bottle thick BBQ, 1 can of beef or chicken broth---or even beer!---braised in oven---this method also makes a dynamite beef brisket!

This was..."eh." Not as much apple flavor as I expected. Had to make do with a pork butt since the butcher didn't have shoulder, but I tried to bump up the flavor with some bourbon and a little apple cider vinegar. We ended up rinsing the sauce off the leftovers, reheating the meat with some chicken broth, and adding some bbq sauce to it to make a punchy bbq pulled pork. Next time we'll just shoot straight for the bbq pork and skip the cider and onions.

Believe it or not my pork shoulder was a 10 lb monster! Browned it on the grill outside so as not to grease up the kitchen. It was absolutely amazing - meat fell off the bone and the sauce was incredible. Had it twice as leftovers and still delicious....a real winner.

This was fantastic. I had a 4 lb boneless butt so I made couple of adjustments. Seasoned the roast with salt, pepper and rosemary and refrigerated for about 5-6 hours. I only used 3 large onions (wished I had more)and added garlic, carrots and celery. Used about 2 cups of regular apple cider. Served with mashed turnips and glazed brussel sprouts. Dinner was a big hit! Leftovers were good also.

Rating: 4
Delicious and easy. I modified the reciple only slightly. Instead of returning the pork to an oven-proof pan, I used a 6 1/2 qt. crock pot, started it on high until nearly a boil, then lowered it to low for 8 hours. A friend of mine used pomegraite juice instead of cider and said the results were just as tasty.

This was sooo yummy. I added a sliced bulb of fresh fennel to the pot, which was a tasty addition. This recipe will become a staple in our house.

Porcus Maximus! Unbelievably tender, but I reccommend not reheating: 2 1/2 hours sees this dish cooked perfectly; reheating risks drying the meat out. Also, I deglaze the pot with calvados before adding the cider. And I have made this again and again. With pork shoulder at .99 cents a lb, this is the cheapest dish fit for a king that I have ever come across!

Rating: 4
My brothers said that this was the best food they had eaten in months, and we all agreed that we probably gained 5 pounds from eating it. I had a huge 8 pound shoulder, but it was thoroughly cooked in 4 hours. I added a thyme sprig while it was braising, and I added a rosemary sprig and some apple whiskey to the sauce while it was reducing. I would highly recommend the rosemary and whiskey, and I might try some other reviewers suggestions and add cardamom to the braise. I can see why some people thought that it was a good idea to chill the sauce/pork overnight and then de-fat it before serving. At the least, I wish that I had had a fat separator. I would recommend this recipe for a long, chilly day. We cooked ours while carving pumpkins, and it was perfect. PS--if your onions burn on the bottom, your pan is probably too light-weight.

Rating: 4
this is a delicious recipe. the pork really benefits from the long cooking time. i sauteed the garlic with the onions and added 1/2 cup bourbon and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, the resulting gravy had a pleasant tangy quality. i ran the onions and sauce through a food processor to turn it into gravy. i will def. make this again!

I made the dish as described but made one change: after inserting the garlic, I rubbed the pork with a spice rub from Patricia Wells' Paris Cookbook: 1 teaspoon each of ground nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice and cloves. Then I let the meat sit overnight in the fridge. It was very good and very easy.

For those of you who love to put it in the oven and forget it, this is your recipe! It is so easy and your house will smell great while it is cooking.

Really great fall or winter meal.

Hard to nail down a butcher in Arizona that leaves pork shoulder whole - lots of sliced bone-in shoulder. I bought 5 of those (almost 3 lbs total) and followed recipe exactly except used Guinness instead of cider. It worked better than I thought it would!! Highly recommended. I was testing it for a dinner party and now feel very confident.

Pork shoulder is excellent for braising & this one is now added to our favourites. I doubled the onions; glad I did. I would remove the skin next time and more of the fat as I don't find pork fat delicious in a sauce. It doesn't need that long cooking. I did 2 hours for a 2.5 lb. roast, and although I really sealed the lid, it was drier than some other braised pork. I would roast less than 2 hours next time. I used a German apple cider but I don't think subbing apple juice if that's all that you have, would make much difference. We gave this 9.5 out of 10. I served it with grainy Dijon mashed potatoes. Good!

Rating: 4
Wow. So easy yet flavorful. All of my guests were amazed. I couldn't find cider, so used apple juice. Also, my shoulder was much larger- 10lbs, so I used four extra large onions and two cups of liquid. I also carmelized the onions for about 10 minutes longer, added a few slivered cloves of garlic to the onions during the last 10 minutes of carmelizing along with a teaspoon of rubbed sage and a large pinch of thyme. I roasted for about 5.5 hours, served with mashed potatoes with the onion gravy and brussels sprouts with brown butter and carrots. Everyone said they felt like they were in a french bistro, This will become a staple for company in cool weather.

Fabulous. I used a boneless pork shoulder and strained the fat off the liquid before reducing.

Rating: 3
I loved this pork, but I did make a few adjustments so that I could serve a sauce with egg noodles. I added rubbed sage to the onions when carmelizing them (about a teaspoon). after removing the roast to the platter, I covered it with tinfoil and completed the sauce. I added about half a cup of dry white wine and boiled the sauce for about 5 minutes. Then I used an immersion blender to puree the sauce with the onions and finished it with about 1/4 cup heavy cream. In the meantime I had the egg noodles cooking, I used the sauce and a handful or two of grated parmesan to dress the noodles. I cut the roast up and dressed it with the sauce as well and served with some simple swiss chard...a yummy meal.

This turned out CRAZY good. Like all dutiful Epicurious readers, I felt free to modify, though not much. I used about ten times as much garlic, plus then I sprinkled the roast with granulated garlic, salt and pepper before browning. My roast was a 7-lb monster and I added an entire cup of apple juice, lacking cider. Cooked it for about 3 1/2 hrs at about 375. (My oven runs hot.) Made it a day in advance but was tempted to chuck last's night's dinner and just DIG IN! I'll be serving it with mashed potatoes, to an adoring crowd.

I've made this dish several times, and it's a big hit! I tried using boneless pork shoulder, and it turns out just as great.

I've made this twice now. First, in a Corningware dish (after browning the meat in a frying pan) and the second time in a dutch oven as suggested. The first time was perfection. The second time, the onions turned into a burnt, icky mess. Don't know why. Next time -- and there will be a next time -- it's back to the Corningware.

I have now made this twice and it's wonderful, perfect for a cold winter evening. The best part is the fact that I can make it the night before and stick it in the fridge overnight, then heat it up the next day without any loss of flavor or texture.

Made this for an impromptu dinner for 6 and it was delicious and most importantly.. easy.

Mummm - fabulous! We love delicious "peasant" meat dishes like this! I had a HUGE picnic shoulder and just carmelized the garlic with the onions vs. inserting it. So easy and the house smells fantastic. I like a bit of bay leaf. The onions melt into a wonderful sweet complement.

Rating: 3
Very good. For the previous reviewer, the 3/4 C of apple cider is correct. After cooking it, the liquid from the onions and pork roasting will create a generous amount of liquid, so do not add more than three-quarters of a cup of cider. I added some Dijon mustard as previous reviewer suggested which was good, too. Very easy to do.

This was quite good. I used western style ribs instead of the bone-in shoulder, and they worked just fine. I also threw in a spring of thyme. Served it with mashed potato and celery root. A great fall meal.

Rating: 3
Absolutely delicious and so darn easy! But I found the recipe needed about a 1/4 cup of cider vinegar to balance the sweetness of the onions and cider to make it really outstanding. My Polish butcher didn't do the bone-in shoulder "picnic" cut but I found a nice slab of boneless pork shoulder really works well. Following another reviewer's suggestion, I put 5-6 whole cardamom seeds, a few 1" pieces of whole cinnamon stick and a few cloves in while cooking the onions--a really nice Indian style twist.

Rating: 3
Very good, simple to make, just slightly bland as described....but easily improved on and personalized. My butcher had the proper cut of meat available, and it worked quite well. I did not score the meat and then insert garlic, but rather added thin slices to the onions. What really set it over the top was an apple cider I found that was some kind of holiday blend. It was spiced with cinamon, a small amount of clove, and some all-spice, as well as orange and lemon peel. Obviously this can be easily recreated, and possibly augmented by some cardamom. It's really nice with mashed sweet potatoes. Add a shot of calvados to the sauce before reducing it.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous, easy recipe. I enhanced the overall dish by roasting parsnips, red peppers, onions and carrots separately (in some olive oil) and then serving the dish the mixed roasted vegetables, pork slices on top of that and drizzling the cider jus on top of it all. Absolutely deeelish!

Rating: 4
Couldn't wait to try this after reading other's comments. So simple with only a few ingredients and yet such a wonderful complex and yummy result. Took many hints from others, horseradish mashed potatoes were a perfect companion. Will use more onions and apple cider next time so leftover pork won't be so lonesome on a dynamite open face sandwich.

Rating: 4
This was by far one of the most suprisingly wonderful dishes I have made in ages! The only change I made was to toss it in the crock pot after the pork was browned and the onions carmelized (low for 8 hours). The sauce was deceptively elegant for such a simple recipe. My husband reheated the leftovers (cut up) in the sauce for a fabulous second meal. Don't change a thing! According to my son (who wasn't home for dinner) it was even great cold - high praise from a budding foodie!

Rating: 3
Delicious. Very tender and tasty.I used a dry rub of garlic, onion, and celery salt plus salt and black pepper, paprika, and cardaman. I skipped the onion part. Needs to cook at least 3 hours. Use 1-2 cups of cider/apple juice and remove drippings at least 1 hour before finish to separate fat from sauce. Sauce very flavorable but too fatty if not separated. Serve with apple sauce and roasted root vegetables.

This was the most amazing pork recipe I have ever tasted, & I eat a lot of pork! Just bought a Turbo Cooker & put it to the test. The flavors were beyond words.

WOWEE!!!!!!!!!

Used wild boar boneless shoulder. Excellent, sweet caramelized onion sauce...made more palatible by pouring off the liquid and discarding fat before serving. Surrounded the platter of meat, covered with onion sauce, with slices of fried apple/chicken sausage. Thus, those that tired of pork flavor could have a taste of sausage, then back to the pork. They ate every bite ... except a small portion everyone took home for a sandwich. Great way to mellow the flavor of wild boar, and to ensure a moist roast.

Rating: 2
The flavor is very good, and the meat is very tender. But I had a problem with the bottom of the pot turning black, and then there were pieces of black, burned stuff that came loose while the juices were reducing and got mixed in with the onions. (My husband didn't mind it, but he'll eat almost anything. I'm glad I wasn't serving this to company!) Obviously, medium high is too high on my stove. How did others serve this? And what did you serve with it?

Rating: 2
I will try this again, although I didn't like it as much as some other reviewers (or my dinner guests). Possibly because I used a blade roast -- I will try again with the arm side as suggested in the recipe -- and also possibly because I have been eating mostly low fat meals recently which this definitely isn't. I have to admit that the meat was wonderfully tenderized by the cider which also gave it a nice flavor, but overall the dish was a little more rich and one-dimensional than I would have liked. I used 1.5 cups of cider as recommended by other reviewers which was definitely the right call.

Just made this entree last night for my husband and I and it was fantastic! For the minimal amount of required ingredients, the flavors were spectacular. My husband said he could eat this every night! I could not find the arm picnic cut of the pork shoulder and used pork shoulder blade steak (about 2 lbs which would feed about 2 1/2- 3 people.

I loved this dish! What a wonderful way to turn an inexpensive cut into company-worthy fare. As I was making the dish, however, I realized I had no cider and substituted a can of beer instead. Excellent!

Very good, very easy, and completely do ahead dinner that feeds a lot very economically. The entire roast was $7 and could have fed 8 people. Served with mashed potatoes. I brined my roast for 6 hours in 1C each kosher salt and brown sugar with about a gallon or two of water. I also added quite a bit more cider than called for as I thought a scant 3/4 C would boil away. And I probably cooked the pork for 3.5 hours. Finally, I did add a little cornstarch to the cider reduction to thicken it up a bit before serving. All of which I would do again. Still, not as good as the Six Hour Pork Roast recipe also on this site.
