This is a great recipe pretty close to the one I remember from my childhood. I wouldn't add salt. I would reduce the amount of yeast to two packets though.

Hi To you all and Happy Easter 4-14-06..I have been looking for this recipe for years !!! My grandmother, born 1889 and my mother, born 1926, have made this but my wonderful mother lost it some how. I've tried numerous recipes but they were all like crumbly bread rather than the stretchy dough this sounds like it would make. I've read all the reviews and I am going to make this as printed and will let you all know how it went. I may use some of the salt, yeast and sugar suggestions on a later batch. If this is anything like my grandmothers, then you are all in for a treat.

Note about salt in yeast doughs: it's what controls the yeast action so that the dough doesn't over-rise, then deflate when baking. Salt also enhances the taste in all baked goods. That recipe needed major changes. Compare with your books,especially egg doughs.

I thought this bread was good- especially for my first time out every making homemade bread. I would have added more lemon zest to give the bread a little more punch. I also think it would be tasty with the optional glaze (I only used egg wash). I also don't think I proofed this long enough (or it could have been the HUGE amount of yeast) because the bread rose considerable in the oven during baking- so much so that it practically lost it's braided shape. I would make it again though- with more lemon, less yeast.

The bread turned out really delicious. It rose wonderfully without the addition of salt and was really fun to shape.

Salt is critical to any yeast dough. It's missing here; 7 cups flour needs 1 1/2 tsp.salt. Sugar measure is excessive -3/4 cup sugar is plenty for this recipe. Yeast measure is also too much. One yeast cake OR two pkgs dry yeast, OR one tablespoon SAF is plenty. Oven temp is off-to bake two large 'braids' with eggs, use 350F for approx 40 min. Use uncooked,washed eggs.Traditional Easter breads like this have many adaptations, but basic formula for yeast dough should be kept.I suspect contributing baker guess-timated the quantities. Note: using part butter,part oil will enhance taste-For this recipe 1/2 cup total is more than enough.

With all due respect to Filomena, a quarter pound or 7.5 packages of yeast is overkill for only seven cups of flour. Two envelopes of active dry yeast is plenty. If it makes you feel more secure, you can use SAF Gold or Fermipan Brown yeast. These yeasts work especially well with doughs that have a higher proportion of sugar - but frankly, 2 envelopes of Fleishmann's or Red Star active dry yeast should be fine. Large quantities of fat can inhibit yeast action, and this bread has quite of bit of egg yolk in addition to the olive oil. To compensate, start by making sponge with the dry yeast dissolved in 1 cup of warm water along with 1 cup of the flour and a teaspoon of the sugar. Also, you can braid the bread without adding the traditional hardboiled eggs. Still delicious!

The bread is great....just like Grandma made. I do have a suggestion. Use small uncooked eggs for the decorations. They will cook while the bread is baking! If you boil them first then bake them again, they will be almost inedible..........a hint from my grandma.
