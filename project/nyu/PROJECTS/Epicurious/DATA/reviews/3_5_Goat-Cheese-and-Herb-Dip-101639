Very delicious! It did seem to firm up a lot while sitting in the fridge so I was nervous that it would be more like a spread, but as it came to room temperature in time to serve it was loose enough to do the job. I did add honey and what a compliment. This is a new addition to my party table.

I think I added a bit too much yogurt - this was good and attractive but not great.

I have made this a bunch of times, to rave reviews. It is now my go-to dip recipe. I love going out to the garden to collect the mint, thyme and rosemary :) It is a really nice dip with veggies or ripple chips. I add quite a bit more yogurt to cut the goat cheese taste down (ie 250ml) and have thrown in some butter milk as well to loosen it up. Make sure to leave it 1hour+ in fridge for flavours to blend.

While this is delicious (who doesn't love goat cheese), I think it turns out a little bit thick to be considered a "dip" - it's really more like a spread. This held up well in the fridge for several days after I made it.

Very nice. I went easy on the rosemary because of it's intensity. Added honey per another review and it took the edge off. Many compliments from my friends with high taste.

I made this for a dinner party of four and everybody LOVED it! They kept dipping and dipping... I served several kinds of veggies with it but the most popular were toasted whole wheat baguette slices.

This recipe is amazing and extremely versatile. I just chop up the herbs by hand and mix it all together in my Kitchenaid. I have substituted sage for thyme, arugula for cilantro, you name it. I always add the honey as one reviewer wisely suggested. It tastes great every time. I use bright pink redbud flowers from the tree in my yard and they create a gorgeous contrast.

I served this as an appetizer at a summer supper for guests, and everyone enjoyed it. While preparing it, I thought it was a touch bitter (maybe from the yogurt), so I added a tablespoon of honey. I used fresh basil rather than cilantro, and I did not use mint. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe and super flavorful! I served this as an appetizer before a large dinner party and it was a BIG hit. I didn't bother putting in the edible flowers, as I think the green of the herbs is nice on its own. I will definitely make this recipe again.

My friends loved this recipe. I used a few rose petals and lavender for color. I used a little too much lavender, but all agreed that it was terrific with a crudite, especially with blanched asparagus.

I would not make this again as a dip. The goat cheese overpowered the herbs and it basically tasted like runny goat cheese. I'm not going to serve this as a dip but I may try and use some of it up as a sauce.

Bland and uninteresting.

I made this dip along with some others, for a party and although the others were gone by the end of the night, this one was barely touched. It has a delicate flavor that doesn't compare well to other more savory dips. In other words, not the type of thing to serve, say, a bunch of guys at a Super Bowl party!

This is a great dip. I used non-fat yogurt and drained it first (yogurt cheese.) The flavors are sharp, but mellow if allowed to marrow for a few hours. Definitely a keeper. Even my daughters liked it and asked how I made it.

Absolutely delicious! Dealing with the herbs can be a bit tedious (not to mention all the leftovers), as well as trying to blend the goat cheese in a blender (if you don't own a food processor, like me), but the results are well worth it. Toppping it with the edible flowers is a nice touch. Will make again and again!

This dip was wonderful! I don't understand 8/18/01 comments. Maybe she used bad goat cheese or did not wash the herbs adequately. It is definitely not for the mild tasters, but you should know that based on the ingredients - no surprises! I used this recipe for a very large crudite platter (two 16"x16" slate slabs) served in hollowed out peppers, for a party of 30. It went over very well. But the trick is to serve this tasty and beautiful dip alongside a more mild dip. That way you please all palettes.

This dip was absolutely terrible. The only reason I gave it a score of 1 was because 0 was not an option. The texture was grainy. The cheese and herbs seemed to be in battle over which one should be the dominant flavor with both ultimately losing the fight. Far too overpowering. This dip went basically from my refrigerator to my garbage disposal.

I made this for a party and served with an assortment of raw vedgetables. It was wonderful! I added the flowers as well, which gave it wonderful color. Everyone loved it! A great dish you can make the night before for a party.

A great dip! The yogurt mellows the taste of the goat cheese to make it appealing even to those who don't like goat cheese flavor. I served it to my bookclub with the toasted baguette slices and red wine. It was a hit!

I tried this recipe several months ago when I saw it in Bon Appetit and have made it 10+ times since then. I must admit....friends & guests beg for the recipe!

A perfect dip for goat cheese lovers. My only complaint is that fresh herbs are so expensive and dried don't do the dip justice. Perhaps a little roasted garlic to spread as well for a kick.

The flavor was good, but this recipes takes alot of prep work. Also, I had to buy all the fresh herbs at the store so it was a bit pricey too.

Incredible! The blend of fresh herbs in this dip is wonderful; not overpowering with onions or garlic, like many dips! Coach makes a lower fat variety of the goat cheese, which made it more heart healthy and did not change the taste. Another recipe in which to use all those herbs from my garden!

Yuck, I did not like this. I followed this exactly as written, and still didn't like it-- neither did most of my guests. I guess it depends on tastes maybe.

This is an excellent dip. I substitued basil for the mint (I don't like mint). I used the left over dip for the filling in squash blossom rellenos. YUM

This dip is simply delicious and it is so simple to make. The hardest part is finding the fresh herbs! Only took about 10 minutes to make though and everybody loved it!!!!!

Very delightful blend of flavors. Great appetiser for my Bastille Day dinner. Served with homemade french bread. Would have been great as a vegetable dip.

This is an incredible dip. I doubled the recipe and served it with baguettes. I didn't add the edible flowers but decorated with pineapple mint (the same mint I used in the dip). I did make the mistake of putting it in one container and it was gone before all the guests arrived! I'm certain one can use many combinations of herbs and I know I'll be "playing" with this recipe for many years.

This dip is delicious. I served it with some spicy pepper crackers and strips of red peppers. it was a real hit. The edible flowers didn't add very much color to the dip with all of the fresh herbs. I did garnish it with some mint leaves and a few edible flowers to create a "bouquet" garnish. It was very pretty and appealing.
