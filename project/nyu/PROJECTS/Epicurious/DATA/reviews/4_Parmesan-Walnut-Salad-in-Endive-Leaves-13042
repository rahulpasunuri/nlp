I have made this recipe several times and have received excellent reviews. It can be made ahead and then assembled at the last minute. Tastes like 5 forks!! Excellent with wine and requires no crackers. Very healthy and tasty!

This was a great sucess the three times I made this. It was a wonderful appetizer with wine! I love the fact that it uses endive leaves rather than your standard crackers!I highly recommend this one!!!

This is a great alternative to a standard salad during a dinner party. It tastes great and is finger friendly. It looks great on a serving plate, too. I made two batches, one with a domestic but high quality parm and one with parm reggiano. The latter is much better in this recipe IMO. Parm Reg has a lower salt content and has the flavor qualities that just can't be duplicated. A great thing about this recipe is that you can do almost all the prep ahead of time (day before in our case). On the day of the party, we simply added the walnut and parsley and assembled the endive cups.

If I could, I would give this 10 forks! Every time I make this recipe for a party I get several requests for it. It is absolutely perfect exactly as it is. Yummmmmmmmmmmmmy!

Delicious and quite easy to assemble. I will make again as is or may try adding either apple or dried fruit.

The only comment I can make is to make 1/2 of the filling minus the walnuts as some people have nut allergies and it's too good for them not to be able to enjoy. Thx to my friend Liz who introduced this to me many years ago...always a hit!

I've been making this since the recipe was first published and no one tires of it (most especially my husband). Terrific flavors; fresh; light. Always a hit

This recipe was excellent! After reading previous reviews, decided to use pecans instead of walnuts and add some diced granny smith apple.

Fantastic and easy (if you don't mind all of the chopping).

These are so simple and easy to make but look impressive. I like to finely grate the parmesan rather than dice it. It's holds together better in the leave.

Wow-- so pretty and delicious... served this at a party with other apps and it was the first to go, and the most talked about! People couldn't figure out what was in it, but they loved it!

Delicious and very easy; I'll definitely make this again. The only thing I did differently was cut the Parmesan into matchstick-size slivers rather than dice it; I think this makes for a more elegant and more modern presentation. (Also, I spooned the salad into the endive leaves; it simply looks better than serving it chips & dip-style). Make sure you use top-quality ingredients because this is a simple recipe and you will taste all the individual components. I like Gourmet Garage's house-brand olive oil, but I think any good quality fruity and peppery olive oil would work well here.

I'm about to make this recipe for the 3rd time in as many weeks, for a potluck. The salad by itself on the first day seems to be lacking something, but with the bitterness of the endive leaves, it is perfect. On the second day however, the salad can stand on it's own, and we've been known to eat the leftovers with a spoon. The only thing I add to the recipe is a pinch of salt & pepper. Other than that, I make it as written. Fabulous!

My vegetarian friend couldn't stop eating these. This was easy to make and the endive was a nice change from the usual crackers or celery as dippers. Might try pecans next time. Otherwise, wouldn't change a thing.

Yum!! One non-foodie guest who normally douses everything he eats with salt proclaimed the endive as "the perfect dipper" and couldn't stop eating this. I've also used it for catering, but only because Costco is a great source for inexpensive but good-quality Reggiano-Parmigiano. And its true that it never looks like enough, but a little goes a long way. I'm thinking of adding diced tart apple next time to make it a little brighter tasting, though.

This is easy and elegant. I was a little nervous that there would not be enough salad to fill the endives, but it works out fine. Don't be alarmed when it looks like the volume of salad is too small. This is a great recipe!

I make this when I need to take a dish somewhere. I never bring any of it home. I have shared the recipe with several. Wouldn't change a thing.

Very easy to make and always well received. FYI pine nuts make a nice substitution.

Super easy to make and delicious. I arranged the endive on a platter in the shape of a flower. Folks were impressed.

This is a great recipe for parties in the endive - a crowd pleaser. However, I was not entirely happy with the flavor of the walnuts (no one complained, mind you), but I get such a great reaction to it that I tried a variation so I could serve it as an appetizer for a small dinner party in place of the average salad before risotto: I prepared 1/2 the recipe (this works just fine), and instead of toasted walnuts, I used pecans. I hollowed out 4 small tomatoes and finely cut up one more. I did use endive, but I cut it into fine strips and added it to the salad. I stirred the chopped tomato into the salad right before serving, and then stuffed the hollowed tomatoes with the mixture, sprinkling fresh parsley over the plates. Not only beautiful, but the addition of the tomatoes lightened it up enough to be eaten before a mushroom risotto (the earthy pecans really set the scene nicely for the entree). Both my boyfriend and I liked this variation a little better - the flavor is a little lighter, and the pecans eliminate the risk of bitterness.

AMAZING flavors! Use good Parmesan - at least half Parmesan Reggiano - for the best taste. The combination of flavors is intense and remarkable. For ease of serving have the filling in one bowl and the endive leaves on a separate plate - it will keep for a few days this way (store endive as described in the recipe). A big hit at parties!
