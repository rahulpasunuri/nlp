As another reviewer said, i think the cake (which i made as cupcakes) is definitely good but i've had better and i think more of a two forks recipe. The frosting, on the other hand, is downright yummy and unique to others and worthy of full four forks! For those wondering how to do the caramel, you really need to keep the pot on a very high temp with the water/sugar boiling to achieve the "amber" color (which took more than 10 minutes for me). When its gotten there, it will be the consistency of heavy maple syrup & thats when you add the cream. after that the rest is dead easy.

This cake is UNBELIEVABLY GOOD and is definitely worth the time and effort it takes to create. I recently made it a second time and provided you follow the instructions correctly it comes out beautifully.

I've tried a few times but haven't gotten the frosting to come together correctly yet. If it wasn't so delicious I would stop trying, as it's definitely a pain.

To the Chicago cook who wondered why her cake was dense and didn't rise-- That usually means either the baking powder was expired or the flour was beaten too long. Make sure all ingredients are room temperature before beginning baking. This makes it easier to blend the batter without overwhipping the flour. Additionally, I incorporate the flour mixture with my mixer on the slowest setting, then when I see it's almost combined, I turn off the mixer and stir the last bit by hand. This should begin to eliminate the problem of dense/not risen cakes.

I only made the cake, not the icing. Buttermilk is kind of expensive where I live, so I subbed it out for plain Greek yoghurt instead. Very tasty cake! My oven runs a bit hotter than it should, so I baked it at 325 for about half an hour which made a little more dense and almost like a brownie. I only made two cakes as well as I only have two cake pans didn't notice it called for three until it was too late. We put cream cheese frosting on the cake because that's what we like in our house.

The first time I made this cake I used cake flour, but the cake was too "delicate" for the frosting. My cake literally tore apart. The second time I made it I used all purpose flour, and had no problems. This is over the top chocolatey, and could easily serve more than 12 people because it's so rich. But for a chocolate lover like myself, this is the ultimate cake!

The frosting was tricky, I burned the first set of caramel, but the second one was ok. It took awhile to cool, and I was really worried it would just be a bowl of liquidy chocolate. In the end it came together and was good. I probably won't do it again though, a simple ganache is so much easier and maybe even more elegant.

This cake turned out so well. I'm not sure if I got the frosting quite right, but it tasted delicious. When I made the caramel, after adding the cream, it stayed very liquid-y - I'm not sure if this is correct? I still added it to the chocolates and proceeded per the instructions, I just don't know if my caramel needed to be thicker. Regardless, the cake was a huge hit. I'm actually making it again this coming weekend. I thought the cake and frosting paired well together. It's the kind of cake that screams for a tall glass of milk.

This recipe is massively flawed in that it does not specify the consistency of the caramel. I ruined 24 oz of good chocolate as a result and wound up having to run to the store and buy pre-made frosting as a result. HORRIBLE!!! I cooked the caramel for over a half an hour until it finally started to get yellowy. I then added the cream slowly and the result was total liquid. As such, I continuted to cook the mixture over medium heat until it reached a caramel-like texture. I then added the caramel to the chocolate and tried to stir around but the mixture quickly grew very stiff. So, I then tried to warm the mixture using a double boiler. Nothing was helping and I must have burned my hands 3 times. I then added a little more cream to the mixture hoping that would help it along. DISASTER. Oils started separating from the chocolate and the mixture is virtually unusable. ! $17 worth of chocolate down the drain. And 1 very dissappointed cook.

This cake was REALLY good. It made way too much frosting and I used a little more than half of it. Also, the frosting wasn't very frosting-y as I thought it was going to be. It was very rich and dense, but tasted GREAT.

This is my second attempt at this icing and I'm having exactly the same experience- my sugar never turns color. It stays white. I boiled it until it was candy last time and had to start over, so this time I stoppoed boiling when it was thick, and added the cream. I estimate I cooked it 30 minutes. I then cooked the cream and sugar together, hoping it would start looking like caramel and it never did. The only thing I can think is that it's the pan- both times I used heavy analon saucepans. Not sure what that could matter, but it's the common thread. Since I'm pouring it into chocolate and the end result will be brown anyway, I'm not so focused on the color but it does affect the texture, which is already thin. Last year I reheated it and beat butter chips into the icing and turned it into a buttercream (which was Fab). This year I cut back on the liquid:chocolate ratio and will use it as Ganache. However I will not be beaten!! I WILL get this recipe to come out someday...but alas it will not be today. Still tastes good, though!

I'm not sure where exactly I went wrong... both the cake and frosting tasted absolutely delicious!! But the cake (once cooked) was incredibly dense and didn't rise at all; while the frosting (once cooled and then sat at room temp) would never get stiff enough to actually ice the cake! Help! I absolutely loved the flavors of everything, but I am not a professional baker so there is definitely some room for improvement. The caramel turned out fabulous, I weighed out the correct amount of chocolate...

Admittedly, I did not make the cake part of this one, just the frosting. I used my go-to favorite chocolate cake recipe from the Joy of Cooking. The frosting was outstanding - best chocolate frosting I've ever had. It takes patience, but is well worth the effort.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly and found both the cake and the frosting to be quite delicious separately. The cake is moist and rich without being too heavy. The frosting has a very smooth, pleasant texture, and a nice flavor (though the chocolate really drowned out the caramel, I'd probably use half the chocolate if I were to make it again). Unfortunately I didn't think that they worked terribly well together. The end result was just too rich for my taste. If you like extremely rich/sweet cake, this is definitely for you. If not, try the cake with a lighter frosting or the frosting with a lighter cake (or really I think it would be perfect between a couple of shortbread cookies!).

Rating: 3
A lot of work, but delicious! The cake was crumbly, maybe because it spent too much time in the freezer between frosting coats? Still won rave reviews. I most likely will not make it again because the caramel step was a lot of work. I never thought I'd get it fully mixed with the cream!

I made this today for christmas dessert december 2010 and I have tried the cake itself yet but the frosting is very delicious. I was a bit intimidated making the caramel as this was my first time and have always shied away from doing a caramel on the stove but I read the other reviews and mine actually took about 30 minutes to turn amber color. I think I may have simmered too slowly. When I poured the cream into the caramel it seemed to turn the caramel into a hard ball but after simmering a few minutes more it turned very smooth. I put the frosting outside to cool, very cold in CT today and after 2 hours brought it in and whipped it and in no time it was finished. This is the most velvetiest and smoothest frosting I have ver made. It also tastes like a Mily Way bar!

I made the cake last night. I used two 8x2 round pans and it took approximately 35 minutes to bake the cakes. The cake tastes great by itself, but it's entirely too sweet with this frosting. Also, please take note of the butter discrepancy. I agree that omitting the chocolate chips is a good idea or perhaps using a salt caramel frosting with this cake is a better choice. I made the frosting following the suggestions of a slow boil for 25 minutes and it seemed to turn out ok, except for the texture. It appears to be a bit runny and does not spread easily on the cake. Also, there is a considerable amount leftover. I'll probably make the recipe again maybe as a bundt cake (minus the chocolate chips) to use up the remaining soupy icing.

I'm almost embarrassed to admit this, but I made this frosting with a ready-made caramel (one pound of Mrs. Richardsons' Butterscotch Caramel sauce, available in the ice cream topping section of the grocers). I had very little time this morning to make the frosting, and figured it was worth a shot - at the worst I'd end up with a yummy caramel chocolate sauce for future ice cream topping - the end result was PERFECT! Rich, caramel chocolate flavor with a slightly caramelly consistency - has spread very nicely on both crumb and frosting coatings. My steps: pour entire container of caramel into a saucepan over medium heat, heat until caramel begins to bubble ever so slightly. Add 2 cups of heavy cream, reduced from 2.25 in the recipe - stir to combine and heat until boiling - then follow directions on original recipe sheet. A great middle ground for those wanting to try something new but lacking time and or guts to make caramel from scratch.

This is to Sara Bourne. I haven't made this recipe yet, but I did make a successful batch of caramel yesterday, after a failed attempt. I'd strongly suggest for anyone who's never made caramel before to Google "how to make caramel". I did so & found a video demonstration, which I watched before and after the failed batch. Although I never stirred the caramel, I swirled the pan, but WAY too much. The 2nd time, I only swirled it once - leaving it alone made all the difference. But be really careful - I got a small bit of caramel on my hand from a spoon & have an enormous blister. And no, I wouldn't whip the cream first. Good luck! I look forward to trying this recipe soon!

This is to Jo Ester. This is the most requested cake I make. When following the frosting recipe exactly, I find the frosting melts at warmer room temps and slides off the cake, behaving much like a truffle. I have found that if I warm the heavy cream and add it to the sugar water BEFORE it gets to that amber, while still pale golden, and then then cook the caramel until it is a rich amber hue, then add the chocolate, the frosting holds it own. It spreads well, stays set and looks glorious. I hope this helped.

I haven't made this cake yet, but I'm hoping someone who has can answer me - what consistency does the frosting have once it's dry (one or two days after baking)? I want to add some flowers to the top and sides of this cake and want to make sure the frosting dries well enough to allow for decorations. Thanks.

I almost didn't make this because of the mixed reviews and because, although I am a decent cook, my baking is pretty much limited to no-knead bread and chocolate chip cookies. BUT this recipe was pretty straight forward and came out as a solid 3.5 forks in my hands. READ the reviewers' suggestions on this site! While the instructions are very good, several tips saved me, including the need to slowly boil (not simmer) the caramel for closer to 20-25 minutes, refrigerating the frosting overnight (and whipping it in batches), freezing the layers to ease assembly, and using a spatula dipped in hot water to help spread the frosting. I was really worried the cake was too dry (my oven temp was off) and almost made another cake last minute, but the icing pulled it all together and, if anything, it has gotten better over time (it's now three days post-baking and just as yummy), which is good, because it really is a two-day investment in time. Btw, I had "yes" votes from my husband's birthday guests on the chocolate chips and, like others have said, it is very rich. In case you were curious, each one of the 16 generous pieces this cake makes weighs in at about 950 calories.

I only made the frosting but WOW it is delicious! I ended up making the caramel with whipping creme added at the beginning. I allowed it to boil slowly then proceeded as directed. We really enjoy the fluffyness of the icing without being overly sweet. Bernard Callebaut. Chocolate makes for a sublime taste.

i made this recipe years ago and all i remember was that it was literally sliding off of itself (the layers wouldn't stay put, and the frosting was really soupy). a LOT of work for what's basically a 4-layer chocolate cake with a pretty boring flavor. if you want a great chocolate cake, stick with the devil's food with orange buttercream...

Hello!!! I wanted to write a review because I really like the feedback and rely on it when using online recipes. I just made the frosing for this cake and it turned out great!!! A rich and creamy texture although not as "caramely" as I would like. Very decadent an chocolatey though!! To save some money I used the 11.5 oz bags of ghiradelli choocolate and it turned out fine!! I had some slight concern about the sugar/water caramel process. I ended up cooking boiling mixture for 20-25 minutes...yes it does take longer then the specified 10! It didn't get as deep an amber color as I expected but defenitely darkened. I took it off flame as I didn't want it to burn and was fine!! I then put frosting in fridge and when I took out the consistency was perfect. After I spread the middle layer of the cake the frosting became too hard to spread without tearing the cake. I simply put it over the pan of boiling water to heat it up and then remixed for a bit. You have to becareful not to over heat the frosting when you do this or it will just melt. I had mine on the boiling h2o for about 10 seconds. I was also wondering if I would have too much frosting and I do...I would make only 2/3 of the recipe next time. You could also go for 1/2 and that would probably be great too. I am pairing this frosting with the Double Chocolate Layer cake from the website because it got better reveiws then this one. Have to say I have only tasted the frosting and cake seperatly thus far but both are VERY rich...although delicious!!!

HELP!! I followed the direction exactly and the frosting is a massive FAIL. Questions: Should I increase the heat from medium to boil the sugar? Should I whip the heavy whipping cream before putting it into the pot? Problem: My sugar never turned to caramel, it just boiled white and when it started to harden after 20 min I put in the whipped cream. Yes, I whipped it before putting into the "caramel". ? The combo just boiled and looked weird. Help is appreciated, off to the store to buy more whipping cream and try this again...

I followed the recipe exactly except I made cupcakes out of part of it and did a single layer sort of cake/tart out of part. I had a lot of trouble with the caramel, but that was my problem, and I used Scharffen Berger chocolate which cost a lot, but the results were sublime - soooo worth it. My girlfriend and her friends still talk about it, and I made it like four months ago. It cemented my reputation as a good baker.

Thank you everyone for your reviews it helped me make a great success out of this cake. It is a light and delicious cake. I was able to make it moist by adding 2 tablespoons of mayonaise in addition to the buttermilk. I also increased the amount of buttermilk because I could tell the batter was not quite right. My recommendation is to modify the recipe as follows: Put 1 1/4 cups of buttermilk and when adding the buttermilk to the mixture in your second pouring of milk add 2-4 tablespoons of mayonaise. Also I made this cake in a bunt pan which took 3/4 of the batter and 42 minutes to bake. With the rest of my batter I made cupcakes they only took 17-18 minutes to bake. Hope this is helpful

I'm about to make this cake, but I do want to point something out in the ingredient list. One needs one cup plus two tablespoons of butter; this is alternately listed as two and one-half sticks. Since there are eight tablespoons in a stick of butter, the alternate note is incorrect. Perhaps some epicurious editor could look this over and correct it. Thanks!

I made this for my daughters 21st Birthday, it was a great success. I followed the exact instructions, I made the cakes one evening and in the morning I made the frosting. What a beautiful cake, the frosting was generous but I spread out every last bit. The carmelization process took longer than 10 minutes, but be careful because when it does turn a golden amber, it does almost immediately. Our cake served well over 12 people, with leftovers!

I was looking for a chocolate cake recipe for a last minute celebration dinner and gave this one a try. I didn't have time to make this icing, so I used a basic chocolate glaze instead. It was very good. Maybe well served by a light accompaniment like berries or creme. Although not SOOO good that I would run back to make it again. Either way, it might be very helpful to know that this cake's texture is extremely light and even crumbly. It is very delicate... easy to break. You will not want to skip the parchment paper rounds in the bottom of the pans and be prepared to handle with much care.

Great cake, the layers turned out flatter than I expected, but by the time they were stacked and frosted, the cake height was perfect. However, I did want to note that the recipe for the frosting made about twice as much as necessary, even with a generous hand! Plan to bake an extra batch of cupcakes to use up the rest of the frosting, because it's way too good to waste.

Yummy chocolate cake! I didn't have cake flour on hand so I used the flour & corn starch trick. I also only had 2 10" cake pans rather than 3 9", so the cake was a bit shorter than the cake in the photo. Rather than beating the cake ingredients together, I gently folded them to try to get the cake as light and airy as possible. It worked well. The caramel took longer than 10 minutes to turn amber, but I used a small sauce pan. I also did not get any hard caramel bits, but did end up with soft caramel as I added the cream. I don't think the cake frosting could taste much better if the caramel turned harder than it did. I will make this again!

WOW! I'm very surprised at the bad reviews. I've made this cake several times and everyone who ate it raved about how delicious it was. I found an easier way to make the frosting. Refrigerate it for an hour. Put the bowl with the frosting in a bowl of ice. Mix on high for a several minutes. When the frosting starts to thicken it gets thick very quickly so you may want take it out of the ice bowl to finish getting it to spreading consistency. Spread immediately.

This cake was kind of a disaster. We made it for a friend who makes cakes for us, and so we've been in a dueling cake contest, and I found this recipe and thought I'd impress everyone.

I used 2 9" pans and did not have any difficulty working with this cake. Per other reviewers suggestions, I omitted the chocolate chips because the cake seemed to be rich enough without them. It was nice and moist. On the other hand, I did have some problems getting the frosting right. I halved the recipe and burned the sugar twice, the 2nd time I was unsure and followed the recipe all the way through, luckily giving it a good taste before I frosted the cake - it was bitter. On the 3rd try I was overly cautious and perhaps didn't cook it long enough because my guests couldn't really taste the caramel. I did not have the consistency problems the other reviewers mentioned; even when burnt the consistency was perfect!

I've had this recipe for years and finally made it for my sister's birthday. The photo is irresistable, but the cake is not. I wish I had read the reviews on this site before I made it. First, the chocolate chips are superfluous- don't use them. They are a distraction to the cake. Secondly, it is critical to let the caramel boil longer than what the recipe says. It needs 15-20 minutes for the amber color. I had to make the caramel twice because the first time I didn't have to 'break up hard pieces' after I added the cream to the water/sugar boil, so I knew it was wrong. Good thing I did- the frosting turned out great. Other than the timing with the frosting, you really need to follow this recipe to the letter, as previously suggested in these reviews. All in all, the cake was good but a lot of work. Not sure it is worth it. I received praise from my guests yet not as much as I usually do for my baking. If you're looking for that old fashioned chocolate layer cake of your youth, this is not it.

This review is for the frosting only. With that being said, I cheated. I used milk and semi sweet chips and halved the recipe for a 13x9 cake and had plenty. The frosting was so easy to make, blended well and a great consistency. Now for the purists out there: using high quality would of course enhance this, but if you're looking for an easy way (and less expensive) I'm here to tell you chips worked well. It tasted great and came together nicely from mixing to spreading to eating!

Did anyone else notice the discrepancy for the butter? 2 tbsp of butter is 1/4 stick, not 1/2 stick. I used 2 tbsp vice 4 tbsp (1/4 stick versus 1/2 stick), so maybe that's why my layers came out so flat??? -Kokomama

The cake and frosting tasted really good, but the layers fell apart as I was lifting them onto one another, even though I handled them as gently as I could.

Went for hedonism and combined this frosting recipe with the Double Chocolate Layer Cake recipe also available at Epicurious (thanks to earlier reviews for this tip). This cake was for a true chocolate cake lover, so the indulgence paid off -- it was a smashing success! Of course, high quality chocolate is an absolute must -- I used Callebaut. To the reviewer below me, I didn't check the temperature of the caramel, but it does take a full 9-10 minutes before making a dark syrup. Then just add the cream. Note: my three forks denote what I consider to be a truly delicious recipe, well worth using when entertaining. Four forks are given very rarely to complex, innovative dishes.

I thought that the cake was good, similar to a devils food cake in texture, but the frosing was excellent. The cake was very thin, not sure if that is how it should be. Perhaps an 8" layer would be best. Didn't use the chips, but couldn't hurt.

This cake is not as good as the double chocolate cake which is here as well. But the frosting is terrific. It does come out a bit thick so I did fold in some whipped cream but it is hands-down one of the most delicious and luscious frostings you will ever make. Be sure to keep it cool!

I made this frosting with a different cake because some reviews said it was too rich. This frosting was to die for! I used Lindt chocolate which was expensive, but worth it. I used my Kitchenaid stand mixer to whip it after chilling, and it came out beautifully. The caramel was the only challenging part, as it did take far longer to turn amber than the recipe stated. I think the frosting would be lovely on a yellow cake, as well. I've already had requests to make it again!

This one of the best chocolate cakes I have tasted. I made it as a birthday cake and 14 people agreed. The only thing I changed was the chocolate chips.

I have to say I almost did not make this cake due to the reviews. The ingredients sounded so good, I decided to try it anyway. I am so very glad I did. It was a simple to follow cake recipe, with a little more detailed frosting. I followed precise directions and the cake and frosting came out perfect! Delicious, dense, & mildly sweet cake, with a smooth decadent frosting. I froze 2 9" cakes for 2 hours, used dental floss to evenly split into four layers, w/ minimal to no crumbling. For the frosting I let come to a "dark amber" color for 16 minutes without stirring, and very slowing added cream. Maybe the key was that I shave the chocolate instead of chop. I made 1/2 recipe for frosting and used Guittard milk choc. chip & Guittard 60% cocoa bittersweet chips, it came out beautifully! Smooth and creamy when only beat for 30 seconds after 2 hr refrigeration. I did omit chips in cake since everyone seems to think they sink to the bottom anyway. Don't be afraid to try this tasty chocolate dessert.

added half chocolate chips and half butterscotch chips to cake. not as moist as some others, but definitely worth making again.

I made this cake in Costa Rica, using the best chocolate bars I could find at the store. I don't know if it was the chocolate I used or just the recipe, but this cake was SO rich no one could handle more than a tiny little peice. But it was SO good. I actually like that you can't eat much because you are satified with just a little bit. I am making it agian here in the states and I hope it turns out just as good.

As recommended by other reviewers, I made the Chocolate Layer Cake, but did make the icing from this recipe. The icing was very popular with all my guests. As I made the whole thing in a matter of hours, I was a little pressed for time. I followed the recipe for the icing, but took a shortcut with the cooling portion - I placed the icing bowl in a bowl of iced water and put it in the fridge for 1 1/4 hours. Afterwards, I let it sit for 1/2 hour, then beat 1/2 the recipe for the required 1 minute. The icing whipped beautifully, spread very well, and kept it's texture for the two hours it sat in the restaurant. I would highly recommend this icing, but only make half the recipe next time, as I have half a bowl left over. Also, for the people who are having trouble with the caramel and may be new to cooking - I made mine on an electric stove with the burner turned to #6 for about 15-17 minutes, and it browned very well.

Icing was wonderful. Chips are overkill in the cake.

I did follow the recipe word to word but I found that the cake falls when it is set to cool and becomes dense. It was not spongy but more like a brownie. Which i did not like. I was hoping to get a lighter texture. The caramel tasted good but one has to be carefully about boiling the water to the amber colour I did not get to that point in 10 mins. I would just rate the cake to be ok , I have tried better recipes here. I will keep looking for my favourite chocolate cake recipe.

Great cake. It doesn't need the chips in the cake part. It is dense enough on its own. The icing was easy and totally delicious. A small piece is all anyone will need.

FAB. The cake is wonderful - but this frosting is to die for. It tastes like the center of those little Lindt-Lindor easter eggs, so wonderfully creamy. I will make the cake again - but this frosting will appear more often than the cake. We'll use it for many other cakes as well, it is SO good!

This was a great cake, very rich and moist. I didn't add any chocolate chips, and thought the cake wasn't too sweet -- perfect for the sweet, rich frosting. The chocolate gets a bit pricey, but is well worth it.

I really didn't care for the cake at all, in fact I pitched it and made the one from "chocolate layer cake w/ milk chocolate frosting" and it went much better but the frosting was GREAT!

I made this cake for my daughter's 4th birthday...yummy! My husband suggested to eliminate the chips next time, but other than that, delicious! I followed others' advice: I froze the cake layers before frosting, but only refrigerated the frosting for 6 hours. When re-beating, only 1 minute is all it takes to bring it together. If you know of a chocoholic, this is the cake to make for them! Time consuming and expensive (Lindt is not cheap) but worthwhile for a special occasion.

I will definitely make this cake again. I also added confectioner's sugar to make the frosting spreadable as well as sweeten it slightly. I chilled the cake and the frosting overnight separately, then constructed the cake the next day. After whipping the frosting until light, the cake came together beautifully.

This is a delicious cake! My son chose this recipe for his 12th birthday and I was reluctant to make it due to some of the reviews. Thank you to everyone who sent tips in - I omitted the chips from the cake, froze the layers, and refrigerated the icing overnight as helpful reviewers suggested and I didn't have any difficulty putting it together at all. The cake itself is absolutely delicious, and the caramel flavour really came through in the icing - it tastes a lot like a more sophisticated Mars bar. We had a large crowd and everyone loved it - especially my son.

Okay, truth be told, I only made the frosting (I made the cake from the Chocolate Layer Cake with Milk Chocolate Frosting on this site), but it was so fabulous - I found it set rather quickly after beating, so it was challenging to spread, but worth every second! Yum!

I made this cake for a Superbowl get together. I have to say this was one of the first recipes I've tried from epicurious that I didn't love. My husband really liked the frosting, but the cake was so-so. I followed the directions for the frosting to the letter, but it never set. I had to add confectioner's sugar in order to make it spreadable. I would make the frosting again, but for another cake.

The cake was fragile and the frosting too thick - which is a horrid combination. After having put so much effort into a beautiful presentation, we were disappointed to find that the flavor is simply boring. A store bought cake mix and tub of frosting wouldn't have tasted worse and would have taken far less time.

Rating: 3
The cake was amazingly yummy - moist, chocolately, but definitely fragile as another reviewer said, especially against the thickness of the frosting. The caramel flavor was totally overwhelmed by the chocolate, so I may try to reduce the chocolate significantly, which I hope will make the flavor more pronounced, and maybe even make it a softer frosting. I will also probably freeze the cake layers before frosting so they aren't totally wrecked again.

I made this for my birthday party. I had no problems w assembly even though it was August in LA because I followed the directions TO THE LETTER. Like the previous reviewer, my friends told me this was the best cake I have ever made (and I bake for a living). Personally, I found it too sweet (I prefer more bitter chocolate) but literally every one else raved. It tasted more like a See's candy than a Milky Way. I would definitely make it again the next time I need to impress someone, especially a chocolate lover.

I made this cake for baby shower at my job, and everyone said it was the best cake I ever made (I have a small cake business). The cake was super moist and the frosting was delicious. The chocolate taste was not too overpowering. It was perfect.

I also made the coconut rice and jerk chicken from this site for the same occasion. Epicurious has done it again!!!!!!

I decided to try this recipe after reading the reviews. The cake turned out great (I left out the chocolate chips) and I had no problems with the icing (refrigerated it for about 5 hrs before whipping it.) Everyone loved it. The frosting is very rich so I didn't use it all. Made the cake again (as a sheet cake) and had just enough of the leftover frosting for it.

Ok, now that it's done, this is a wonderful, incredibly delicious cake. The chocolate/caramel set up nicely in the refrigerator overnight, but in the morning I divided it into two batches to beat in my KitchenAid, and I even had to add a little bit of warm water. The layers I froze WITH THE PARCHMENT PAPER STILL ON--and removed the paper just before assembling. This really helped keep the shape/stability of the fragile layers. My chocolate chips also settled to the bottom, but with freezing with the paper on that was not a problem. I then used a spatula dipped in warm water to apply frosting and it all went together like a dream.

Rating: 4
To answer a pervious question, yes the caramel is a bit soupy in its earliest stages. Once you add the chocolate and refrigerate for a couple of hours, it will set nicely. After refrigeration, I didn't bring it to room temp before mixing and it still produced a nice milk chocolate color. I found it very easy to spread and definitely the best chocolate icing I've ever tasted. The cake layers were very fragile, but with care they remained intact. My only problem was, the chocolate chips settled to the bottom of the pan and then, stuck to the parchment paper. Other than that, this is by far the best Chocolate cake ever. It's unbelievably moist. My friend doesn't like chocolate cake and she said it was the only one she will ever eat.

I wish I had read the comments for this recipe first. I took the recipe directly from the magazine and did not check online. I would have baked it longer and let it cool longer. When I frosted it teh top 2 layers literally fell apart. SO I had a bowl of cake and a one layer cake. No problem though because both went fast! Everyone loved it! When it comes to chocolate my family is very adaptible! The icing was delightful and I had no problems making that. I will make that one often. It is the best chocolate icing! I will make this again as a rectangular one layer cake instead! And make half a recipe of icing becasue you do get a lot.

Okay, I'm not sure what I did wrong,but I also ended up with the soupy mess. I used 24 oz. of the ghiradelli chips plus the bittersweet choc. as directed. My caramel was as close to burnt as possible...I did have it on a higher heat...I think and am wondering if that could have been the problem. One other friend made the recipe and she also said it was a soupy mess...a delicious one, but soupy .

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic cake - needing just a few revisions/additions to the baking directions. Make sure you use best-quality choc. chips; when boiling the sugar-water for the caramel, it takes longer than 10 minutes for he deep amber colour to happen, it's more like 20-25 min. Watch that it doesn't burn (you can tell by the smell). Also, make sure whipping cream is at room temp before adding. After cakes have cooled completely, wrap in plastic and refrigerate over night (makes them much easier to work with - these are VERY fragile cake layers); icing needs quite a while to come to room temp again after chilling (about 2 hours; when you're ready to beat the icing, remove half of it to a smaller bowl, and whip it in 2 batches.It's just to much for one bowl (and your mixer) all at once. I'm a professional baker, and having made hundreds of cakes, I gotta say, this one is absolutley delicious, and the icing is definately worth the effort. Do give yourself lots of time for this cake - it's realisticly a 2 day affair.

Wow! My original post (see below) seems to have touched a few raw nerves! My remark was intended as mere entertainment for those who have enjoyed this website for as long as I have, not as an insult to anyone. My apologies! . . . Just a few observations from a long-time Epicurious reader: the word "definitely" is by far the most misspelled word by those who post comments. The adjectives "awesome" and "phenomenal" (often misspelled) are overused, and border upon hyperbole. The most common insult offered is "get a life." The most common phrases (or variations of them) are "everyone raved," "even my teenager ate it, and she hates everything," "almost everyone asked for the recipe," and "there were no leftovers." I've even seen posts with 2 or more of these phrases in them! My pet-peeve: those who question a recipe's "authenticity," just because it's different than the way "my Italian Grandmother made it," etc. To assert that there is only one way to prepare something is ridiculous. Any other pet-peeves out there, besides those who will say they dislike people like me who post non-recipe-related comments?

Well, I'm going to comment on the recipe rather than the comments. I've made this cake a couple of times now - so obviously I would make this again. It's definitely a major hit of chocolate and the caramel-based frosting is a nice variation. Both times I've made this I've found that the cakes had to be in the over for almost 30 minute before a tester came out cleanly. So I suggest that anyone trying this message plan to add some baking time - the amount will obviously vary based on your local conditions. I also found that there is PLENTY of frosting, so don't skimp on the amount you put between the layers of the cake. All round I'd say I'm very pleased with the results.

I made the frosting to go with my tried-and-true chocolate cake recipe, and was disappointed. I thought this would be a perfect way to use up the remainder of the solid chocolate Easter bunnies we had (which were not the cheapo chocolate). After reading the reviews and following the recipe exactly, I did not get a spreadable icing--I just poured it on and luckily it was just thick enough to stick for the most part. And it made such a vast quantity--enough for two cakes! Last, I think it was too sweet. I will, however, try it again with less sweet chocolate. Before I do that, I have a question: I think I got the sugar syrup to the right color before adding the cream, and the hardened pieces did dissolve for me after adding the cream. Is it supposed to be thick as well as smooth?

I made this cake for a surprise Birthday party and it was a huge hit. After reading some of the other comments I thought I'd reiterate some of the issues which I dealt with on my attempt. This recipe takes a day or more with cooling and sitting time and DEFINITELY follow the recipe exactly. Making the caramel - this took about 20 minutes instead of the recipe's 10 but I did wait until it was deeply brown before adding the cream = perfect! In response to the person who created a clumpy mess after adding the cream - heat could've been too low and I have to wonder if you had been stirring consistently throughout the caramelization process. I'd also recommend bringing the cream closer to room temp before adding.

I made this cake for a birthday party last week and it was a huge hit. I bake a lot and my friends agreed that I had outdone myself with this one. I agree that it is EXTREMELY important to follow the directions closely and to allow the layers and frosting to cool properly. The cake is delicate, but much easier to handle when cooled. Thanks to the cook who recommended using Ghiardelli chocolate chips--for the frosting, I used two bags (11.5 oz each) of milk chocolate plus 4 oz semisweet chips and it was wonderful--not to mention easier and cheaper than buying blocks of chocolate! I am usually not a fan of milk chocolate but it was perfect for this frosting; it really allowed the carmelized flavor to come through.

I am a novice at baking and I warn all other novice bakers to FOLLOW FOLLOW FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS. They are good directions-do not rush them. I also did notice that my carmel took longer to become a golden amber. Perhaps I was not boiling hard enough. I rushed it and it all fell apart right after I put it together. Tried to put the dome on to keep it in. NO LUCK. But we fought over the heavenly mess the next day!!!!

O.K. I'm a cook, not a baker (but I'm learning). This was very good. However, I didn't follow my hard and fast Epicurious.com rules and read the comments thoroughly before I made it. I would have kept the icing in the refrigerator until I was ready to use it. When I let it come to room temp it was a soupy mess. The third layer broke when I was ready to put it on top. It wasn't a good night. My husband had the idea to chill the cake and then spackle the icing into the cracks (which were huge by this point!). It tasted great though. I too will use more semi sweet chocolate in the icing next time. Very good...but a whole day project.

wonderful! for all chocolate lovers- but take your time and plan ahead - make the cake, wrap and put in the fridge and then while the cake is coming to room temp make your caramel and frosting - remember to grate your chocolate very very fine or you will get lumps - i used my food processor and made it very fine - what an excellent icing! the key is patience and planning and you'll have a fabulous cake for all chocoholics!

Wow! A lot of work, but quite good. I used Guittard chocolate chips instead of Lindt. Had a little bit of trouble when making the caramel ... my sugar syrup turned into a rock hard mass when I added the whipping cream. I simmered it until it dissolved again and it tasted fine. Anyone know why that would happen? Is it because my heat was too low?

I am a sugar addict, and I couldn't finish this cake. I loved the frosting, but will use more semi-sweet in the equation next time. It was too sweet. I put the hot melted choc in the freezer for two hours, with the layers, and it came together beautifully. It was an impressive cake to look at, I won't make the cake again. I thought the choc chips were overwhelming, and if you want to use them, I would recommend the mini ones. It was too much to bite into a big chunk of chocolate, after wading through all the rest of it. The cake was only so-so. But don't worry, we'll find a way to eat the rest!

To the Cook from California re: frosting . . . you may not have had the proper (high enough) heat when carmelizing the sugar; also, after pouring the caramel over the chips and stirring until smooth, put your bowl of frosting in another (larger) bowl filled with ice water for about 20 minutes and beat the frosting over while in the bowl of ice water until the color turns to a lighter, milk chocolate color, this eliminates cooling time in the frig.

This cake was fine, but when I go to the trouble of making a chocolate cake from scratch, I'm looking for "drop-dead fantastic"! This cake just wasn't that spectacular-- it's not that it was particularly difficult to make, but rather that it lacked the swoon quality. For future, I will stick with the Double Chocolate Layer Cake that's always on Constant Comment for a different but far superior dessert.

I read and followed lots of reviewers comments. I did follow the recipe exactly and used Lindt chocolate....24 oz is ALOT of chocolate! The cake was moist and so decadent..the chocolate chips are a nice surprise. My frosting didn't set up as wonderful. It was more on the glaze side so after 2 hours I went ahead and melted another bar of chocolate on a double boiler and added it to the frosting and it was perfect...so if anyone else has this problem this is a sure fix. The frosting is wonderful, candy-bar material. If I was to make it again I think I would add more bittersweet chocolate and lessen the milk. I think the final taste would be a chocolate lovers hit and a bit less sweet. This will be my chocolate cake recipe from now on.

As per the request of the cook from Montreal, I'm re-rating this recipe after having made both the cake AND the frosting. The cake is excellent, but honestly I think the frosting is what makes this dessert "to-die-for" caliber. I have made this a couple of times now and have some insight to share: --Use high-quality chocolate - I tried to use Hershey's and the frosting never set up. This may be the issue with some who said that the frosting stayed gooey. --Add some amaretto or almond extract to highlight the chocolate flavor --While the frosting base is still warm, brush the layers with it. It keeps the cake from being too dry. Then chill the remaining frosting before beating. --Make the cake a day or two before serving, and store it in the refrigerator. Then take it out about an hour before serving to soften the frosting a little bit. --This cake is just as good if you use a box mix and just make the frosting!...and a whole lot less of a cash hit for a student on a budget ;). --DO NOT make this cake if you are on a diet. You do NOT have this much willpower. Trust me.....

This recipe is a keeper, exactly as is! The frosting was a little tricky since it was the first time I made caramel sauce. After three tries I got it just right! The trick for me was to use an electric hand mixer when (slowly) adding the cream to the deep amber-colored "sugar-water." Also, (after refrigerating the frosting the prescribed amount of time), I mixed it just a bit too much. Just like the recipe says, if overmixed it will be hard to spread on cake, which it was. So, I set the bowl of frosting over hot water and stirred with a spoon until it softened up again. It then spread on the cake like a charm!! This cake will win the respect of all chocolate and non-cholocate lovers alike (in my ever-so-humble opinion)!

I have already made this cake three times in the past three weeks! The first two times I made it I was in a rush- and the layers crumbled because the cake was still hot and the icing just melted. The last time I allowed more time and it came out perfect. Definately tastes better after a day or two.

I used a lot less chocolate in the frosting (I ran out)so I kept it in the fridge overnight and then immediately put it on the cake the next day. It turned out to be a nice glaze-which is probably good because I think thick frosting would have made this too rich. The cake turned out wonderful, its *extremely* moist, and held together nicely. For you chocoholics like me, this borders almost too chocolatey (almost). I did have to bake it longer than the recommended time. I'll make it again, but I probably won't go with a chocolate frosting next time.

All I can say is everyone who is altering the icing recipe is making a HUGE mistake. The only alteration I have made is one of timing, it's taking me a lot longer than 10 minutes to get my caramel to the color I like best. But the proportion of milk chocolate to semisweet chocolate is perfect to compliment the caramel. This is my new favorite frosting recipe, and my customers have agreed. Can't keep this cake in the case.

Be sure to make this cake a day or two ahead--it gets better and better sitting at room temperature. The frosting is incredible-you can taste the caramel behind the chocolate flavor. I had no trouble with spreading it on the cake layers, worked beautifully. I used half semi-sweet, half milk chocolate for the frosting, otherwise I think it might have been just a little too sweet for me. Just right with the substitution.

This cake was really very good. But how on earth can 'Dr Sara' rate this recipe honestly (and helpfully for the rest of us) if she left out 13 ingredients and used a boxed cake mix?

I made this cake for an office party and everyone loved it! Had to call it "earthquake cake" because the frosting was too syrupy-thick and broke the layers apart. It was a total mess!!!! I was horrified after the time invested, but amazingly everyone loved it. Great taste, atrocious presentation!!
