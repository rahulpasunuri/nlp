I'm a trini and was happy to see this recipe even though I have a family recipe of my own that I use..I did not add any baking powder never used it in tart before I guess we like it ..I also cut coconut into very small chunks and blend in a blender with about 1 cup of water put on the stove top with sugar and a bayleaf cooken until all liquid was gone...
