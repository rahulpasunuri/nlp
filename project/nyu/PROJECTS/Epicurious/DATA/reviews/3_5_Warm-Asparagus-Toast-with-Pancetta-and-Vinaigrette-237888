The vinaigrette makes this dish, and the pork fat doesn't hurteither. Made this for a dinner party to go with some filets and got great reviews! Not to maention very simple to make. Had to go to Whole Foods because Jewel didn;t have the sherry vinegar, but other than that, no effort whatsoever!

I made this for my boyfriend one night and I have to say, we weren't impressed. So much so that I will not be making this again. It was just weird. I'd rather have my asparagus plain.

We have made this recipe on four different occasions this month for friends and everyone has raved about it. They even tried to talk their spouse out of the second piece. My husband asked me to make extra last time so he could have one the next day. It is easy and the presentation is so great
