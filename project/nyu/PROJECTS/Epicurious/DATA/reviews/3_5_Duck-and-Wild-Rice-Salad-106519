You have to love wild rice to appreciate this dish... I do....had leftover duck breast and really enjoyed the recipe. Accompanied it with a caprese salad...yum. Great summer dinner for me. Used fresh a orange and was not sweet at all. Apricots and toasted pecans a must.

We've been making this recipe as written ever since it was published in Gourmet in 2002. It's fantastic; be sure to cook your wild rice long enough. We love it in the summer because it is light and delicious at room temperature, especially with a nice (dry) rosé.

This salad is a perfect holiday luncheon. I used smoked duck breast ($$$$ but yum and failproof) scored it, and seared it skin side down in a skillet to render the fat. Then I flipped it over, brushed the skin with pomegranate molasses and cracked pepper, and finished warming it in the oven at 375. I plated the room temp salad with 3 good slices (skin on) of duck leaning on each, and garnished the salad with pomegranate seeds. Pinot noir makes a nice wine pairing.

this has been so popular for two dinner parties - so much flavor and texture - can adjust flavors to make less sweet

A very good basic recipe - I used leftover salmon instead of duck, brown rice, and dried cherries instead of apricots. Yummy.

This is a great salad. It gets rave reviews--and unlike most entree salads that we've tried on the menu, it actually sells well. About the only thing we do differently is to add a little sherry vinegar to the dressing to brighten it up a bit. We serve it on a bed of fresh spinach, which sets off the salad nicely.

I have made this many many times, both with and without the duck breast, with awesome reviews everytime. Everyone absolutely loves it! If your recipe is too dry, then double the dressing and use only enough to taste. The rice will absorb some dressing, so keep the extra dressing on hand to add to leftovers. If it's too grainy, then the rice was not cooked long enough. Some recipes take a little bit of fine tuning, or personalizing.

I made this dish for friends for dinner, and it was a great success. I too was concerned that the dressing and apricots would make th dish too sweet, but I found that the results had a good balance of flavors. I didn't use 100% wild rice; instead I used a blend of wild and brown rice. Because of the blended rice I think the pecans got lost and I would have like to have more of the nutty flavor; next time I might use more pecans, or not put them in the food processor to chop. We were only four, and I could have made only half the amount and had plenty of food. This is definitely a recipe for 8. -Claudia

What a waste of time and money! Though it sounded like a great combination of ingredients, I was disappointed before I even served it. Too chewy and grainy and dry.

We were at the cottage for closing and clean up at Thanksgiving and realized we had nothing special for dinner....sent husband out hunting for duck or goose .....comes back with A duck...we had four to feed....what to do.....made the wild duck recipe and added 1 cup of long grain rice to stretch the recipe......was terrific...my husband hates orange juice in any recipe and actually raved when served this wild rice duck dish......company of four (who do not eat game or birds hunted) thought it was excellent. Great as an appetizer or a main meal!!!

I must agree with the reviewer who thought it was horrible. I too was angry that I wasted a duck breast on it. The biggest problem was the dressing, it was too sweet and strong for the dish. Frankly, the apricots can go too. I might attempt the "idea" again, but with significant modifications. With the price of duck, this isn't the recipe to try.

This is an excellent dish. All the ingredients work very well together. We made it the first time with duck breasts and the second time we used leftover quail. I suspect it would be equally good with chicken or turkey. Just don't leave out the crisped skin - one of the best features of the dish.

After hours of preparation (I had no idea what a hassle this recipe would turn out to be), my husband turned up his nose. I was ready to get mad at him until I tried it myself and realized he was right. It was terrible. I lamented wasting two perfectly good duck breasts on this recipe.

This reciepe has made the rest of my family like duck. I was the only one until this reciepe!!! I will make it again and again both for family and for friends. I did use 1 cup wild rice and 1 cup brown rice and I liked that. I used fresh pea's from the garden and if I couldn't get fresh I think frozen would be fine. Try it you'll like it!!!

We had a small catastrophe last week as our children left the freezer open and it thawed almost everything. What upset us the most was the game. I cooked as much of the meat as I could before going out of town for the weekend. We had pheasant pot pie, a tetrazzini, and other casseroles- but I used this recipe with modifications for the wild duck- I will definitely do this one again. I made a smaller amount and replaced the wild rice with a wild rice blend, and replaced the fresh peas with a 1/2 pckg of frozen tiny sweet peas - awesome. I did not add the honey to the dressing and it was plenty sweet with the apricots. A wonderful meal for us or company.
