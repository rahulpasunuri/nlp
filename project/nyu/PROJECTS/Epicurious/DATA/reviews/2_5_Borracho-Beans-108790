I was excited to try this recipe after seeing it on the "Epicurious" show on cable. I read the previous reviews and followed the recipe with the addition of more garlic, one extra bottle of beer (offset with less water), no epazote (couldn't find it) and I used Birdseye chilies, instead of Guajillo. I found our beans to be anything but bland. Apparently Birdeye chilies are ranked a similiar heat as Habaneros. One reviewer suggested adding some bacon, I used the 1 cup that the recipe called for. I did mine in a stock pot, then transferred to a crockpot for the day. They were tneder and quite flavorful, but not for the faint of heart. Next time I will try a milder chili so my children can enjoy them too.

I've had better. Next time I would add bacon and season closer to the end and add some oregano and salsa!

This is kind of bland. I even added more beer near the end of cooking. I will make it again, with some tweaking, most likely more spices, more garlic, and more beer.
