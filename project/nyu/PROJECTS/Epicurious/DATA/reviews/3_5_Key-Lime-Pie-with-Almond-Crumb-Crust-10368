To make this gluten free I use Trader Joes gluten free ginger snaps instead of the graham cracker crumbs, and delete the sugar in the crust recipe. Yum! The ginger flavor worked well with the lime and meringue.

I don't know if I should really be reviewing this recipe, because I used a reviewer's alterations, which almost has completely changed the recipe. I hate meringue on top of key lime pie, and completely ommited it. As for the rest of the pie, I used the alterations from A Cook from Boulder, CO. Chopping the almonds instead of finely grinding them really makes the pie special. And the pie filling recipe in the review tastes so much better as well. So follow that recipe and you will definitely have the best key lime pie ever!

I made this with the meringue on top as the recipe specified, but I think next time I will fold the beaten egg whites into the pie filling without adding to lighten the pie. I used fresh key limes and might have used a couple too many, so we found the pie filling quite intense (both too tart and too sweet, just from the condensed milk). I might also try mixing in whipping cream next time. If you're going to do the meringue on top, I recommended looking beyond this recipe for how to make good meringue, because it's pretty tricky, especially in humid climates. The crust was amazing though. I actually got a store-bought gram cracker pie crust, crumbled it up, added 1/4 c of melted butter and some golden brown sugar to taste in addition to the almond powder. I melted the brown sugar into the butter and pour it over the dry ingredients, then worked the whole thing evenly with my fingers and pressed it into a 10" pie pan. Baked it for 5 minutes, and it held together perfectly. Will definitely use this crust for other pies.

Dated a fellow who had a second home on Maui, surfed, gardened, built green and had a particular attraction to key-lime pie, which he claimed can't be found anywhere other than the islands that was worth a damn. Challenge on! This pie is amazing & perfect. I doubled the non-crust ingredients but otherwise followed the directions exactly as written. After doing the crust and pouring in one portion, it just wasn't enough. Everyone loved it and Mr Wonderful said it was the BEST key lime pie he'd ever had in his life. Success! I'm making it next week for Mr. Marin...

OMG. This pie is amazing & perfect. I made it precisely according to the directions, although I doubled the non-crust ingredients. After doing the crust and pouring in one portion, it just wasn't enough. several people said it was the BEST key lime pie they'd ever had in their life. I was, like, 'no way' and they were, like, 'oh, most definitely way.'

So I changed this recipe a bit...For the crust I did not add any sugar, I felt that the graham crackers made the crust sweet enough. Second I added 2/3 cup (5 limes) of fresh lime juice ( I couldn't find Key Limes let alone want to pay for them). Then after making the filling I made the meringue seperately and then folded that into the lime filling. I wanted something light and fluffy and this definitely did the trick! I figured since it already had raw egg yolks in it raw egg whites weren't going to matter. I added all the meringue to the filling and ended up with extra filling. Next time I may just add 3/4 of meringue instead.

I recently moved to Amsterdam and had a hard time finding all the ingredients I needed. Still this Key lime pie turned out better than any key lime pie I've ever made. I used a apple crumb crust cookie and put it together with the toasted almonds in a food processor. (I no longer needed the butter or sugar for the crust, which probably saved on some carbs and fat). For the filling, I added 2 tblsp apple sauce in place of 1 egg yolk. For the meringue, I added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla sugar. To add more tartness, i added lime zest to the batter and the meringue. This key lime pie is so good, I will only use this recipe in my cooking!!!

Made this for a die- hard key lime pie fanatic's birthday, although I skipped going down the meringue road. She loved it, but I had to come back to thank the cook in Boulder for the idea of using a garlic press to juice key limes. My garlic press has become the single most unnecessary kitchen utensil in my possession given that the time spent digging garlic pieces out of the thing is roughly equivalent to chopping it yourself... but key limes are a perfect fit. Absolutely BRILLIANT.

Oh my. This is absolutely the best pie I have ever tasted (and my husband agrees). I cannot believe that I made it. The combination of creamy, tart, and crunchy is amazing. Next time I will double the lime filling (although I cant imagine how long it will take me to squeeze all of the limes).

A tip when using real key limes: cut the key limes in half and sqeeze the juice using a galic press. I previously reviewed the recipe but came up with process to avoid sqeezing the tiny key limes.

This is the best key lime pie recipe. Ever. Period. Though it seems weird, the toasted rough-chopped almonds are a must. Hand-squeezing an entire bag of TJ's key limes is tiresome, but absolutely worth it (I use slightly more juice, and zest, for a more vibrant filling). Do chill the crust before filling, and do use more melted butter if you find the crust mix too crumbly. Even people who say they hate key lime pie are left begging for a second slice. Top with some homemade whipped cream and you're golden. I've made this six or seven times and am always being asked to make it for my friends' birthdays, etc. If you choose another recipe over this one, you're missing out.

Fantastic pie! I made it for a dinner party I was having and EVERYONE raved about it. The best key lime pie they've had, I was told. The added almonds in the crust are a definite. And I put the crust in the freezer right before baking it to harden the butter again helping to ensure the crust cohesiveness. I used the filling recipe (I think from Joe's) suggested by someone else that just about doubled the filling and added lime zest. I also chose to skip the meringue and substituted freshly whipped cream with some coconut extract, about 1 teaspoon per 1 cup whipping cream, and piped that onto the pie with some toasted coconut sprinkled on top. Delicious!

So I used the updated Joe's Stone Crab recipe from Raisab, Va (Oct. 1999). I have included it at the end of my review for completeness. I used the same almond/graham cracker crust recipe and reduced the sugar to 5 T. Make sure to coarsely chop the almonds. They added a nice contrast to the smoothness of the key lime filling. Everyone was really impressed and was wondering what I did to the crust. For the filling I increased the zest to 1T + 1/2t, and will definitely keep this increase. "BUT FOR FILLING WHISK 6 EGG YOLKS UNTIL BLENDED, ADD TWO CANS SWEETENED CONDENSED MILK, 1TEASPOON GRATED LIME ZEST, AND 1 CUP FRESH (NEVER RECONSTITUTED)KEY LIME JUICE IF AVAILABLE, IF NOT REGULAR LIMES WILL DO. LOOK FOR THE THINNEST SKINNED LIMES. BLEND WELL AND POUR INTO PIE CRUST. BAKE AT 375 DEGREES FOR 10-15 MINUTES. REFRIGERATE FOR AT LEAST 4 HOURS. SERVE WITH WHIPPED CREAM. THIS IS THE RECIPE FROM JOE'S STONE CRABS." This recipe has officially been added to my baking repertoire. This is an excellent Key Lime Pie Recipe.

I omitted the sugar in the crust and served with very lightly sweetened whipped cream instread of meringue. The almonds are a must, and I agree with the recommendation to keep them on the coarser side. Squeezing all those tiny key limes was a chore but the taste was so worth it!

this is a lovely , quick and easy pie to make. It was a bit too sweet for me, don't think you need the added sugar as the condensed milk is sweet enough already. It was a hit and I will definitely make it again, loved the almonds in the crust.

This is a keeper - just ask my 14 year old son! I affirm the cook from Washington, DC's advice to "coarsely chop" the nuts. The crunchy crust was delicious and unique, and lifted right out of the dish! I cannot imagine anyone calling this pie "disappointing." I made it again for St. Patty's Day! Tip: Use whole graham crackers and run them through the food processor. It takes one package to equal one cup.

This was a perfectly tasty Key Lime pie...and super easy to make. The almond crust makes it stand out (subtly) from a more standard key lime pie (I also added a touch of almond extract to the crust). I used bottled Key Lime Juice and nonfat milk and the taste and consistency were great. In addition, I added about 1/3 again as much lime juice and a littel bit of lime zest and the tartness was perfect with whipped cream and berries. A yummy, easy, and refreshing dessert.

This crust was great! Instead of making the almonds into a fine grind, I coarsely chopped them and mixed with the graham cracker crumbs. The larger pieces of almond gave the crust a nutty and cruchy consistency which contrasted well with the smooth filling. I added extra butter as one reviewer suggested. The crust was not crumbly and sliced well.

My husband swapped out the almonds for Oreo cookie crumbs - I thought it would really be weird - but the sweetness and subtlety of the chocolate flavor added something! I ate the whole thing myself. I'd try that again. I think I'll also try the almonds sometime b/c the filling was tasty.

The extra trouble of the almonds definitely wasn't worth it. The strong flavors of the graham crackers and lime overwhelm it. Do a graham cracker crust with sugar and lime zest instead.

Okay, here's scoop on this recipe. Only use the 10" pie pan if you are either making this as written with the meringue OR if you make the famous Joe's recipe found in the reviews and no meringue. My husband didn't like the idea of meringue (said it belongs in Lemon pies) so I went with the idea of whipped cream. I did use the Joe's recipe in a 10" pie pan, although it was a little shy of full it was probably because it was for a deep dish pie. You can find the Key lime juice at Bristol Farms or any fine grocer, and the reviewers are right, it is not green, but yellow. I did not cool the filling after mixing because I perceived that was a step if you use the meringue. Pie set up perfectly and everyone loved it. Was really simple. YOu could use a graham cracker crust from the store and halve Joe's recipe and make it even simpler. I didn't get much notice for the almonds in the crust. Lots of work for little result. Also, it didn't really stick together very well and crumbled when slicing.

Love this recipe. I've made it several times. I usually hand squeeze the key limes, I've tried it with bottled juice and it's still good, but the fresh juice is best. The crust does crumble easily and will stick on the bottom, so I add an extra table spoon of butter and sugar to hold it together, and bake it with the sides covered for and extra 5 minutes. Line the bottom of the pie plate with wax/parchment paper to help with sticking. Mmmmmmm... yummy!

This was awesome, and a real crowd pleaser! I used Nellie & Joe's (bottled) Key West Lime Juice and it was not too tart at all. The crust was fabulous--much better than a pastry crust. I modified the meringue by using 4 egg whites, 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar instead of salt and it turned out beautifully. Ten minutes in the oven was plenty to get the meringue nice and golden--15 minutes in my oven would have ruined it. Will definitely make this one again--soon!

Made this for Easter brunch following a trip to Florida. I used the Joe's Stone Crab recipe and the bottled Key Lime Juice (with the almond graham cracker crust) and I personally loved it and the thick consistency. My family however, thought that it was way too tart and couldn't get beyond the first bite. Does anyone think that I can reduce the amount of lime juice by 1/3rd of a Cup and eliminate the zest to make it more palatable?

I too made the joe's recipe noted by other reviewers with this crust. First time, I used fresh key limes and it was terrific. Last night I used bottled key lime juice and it was way too concentrated and the pie was not as good and almost hurt your tongue. Word to the wise - use fresh juice only!!! Or try the chiffon recipe by the reviewer below if you only have bottled juice so you can lighten it up a bit.

Don't let concerns about salmonella deter you from trying this recipe or the one made famous by Joe's Stone Crab (my favorite of the two). For the paranoid among us, here's a tested workaround: 1. Beat the egg yolks 2. Stir the sweetened condensed milk and the lime juice into the yolks 3. Heat the mixture over hot, not boiling, water, stirring constantly, until mixture reaches 160°F on an instant-read thermometer. 4. Remove from heat, stir in lime zest, pour filling into prepared crust, and proceed with baking instructions (since eggs are already heated when they go into the oven, you may want to reduce baking time by a minute or two). Optionally, if not traditionally, the crust for Joe's pie can be made with half the sugar called for in the recipe, as the filling is very sweet. And I heartily concur with those who feel that a topping of whipped cream - not meringue - is the way to go!

My rating is for the pie crust. I used the Zweiback crumbs with the almond. I feel guilty rating the recipe when I did not even attempt to make the key lime pie filling that the recipe is all about. I have never felt that key lime pie should be heavy and realize that I am truly in the minority on this. Just a difference in taste. I did fill the crust with a chiffon key lime filling using one can of sweetened condensed milk mixed with five egg yolks. To this mixture I added 3/4 of a cup of fresh key lime juice. Using three of the egg whites beaten until they formed soft peaks, I carefully folded them into the mixture without losing any volume and baked in a 325 oven for 20 minutes. Put in the fridge to cool and piped fresh whip cream on the top. So very good and light to the palate. The crust from this recipe is great.

Unless I am missing something here, Both Joe's and the posted recipes are identical, except Joe's doubles the amount of everything escept crust amd therefore produces a thicker, higher pie. In any case, they are delicious! I prefer them with meringue. If you use a pastry bag and make several small peaks of meringue on top of the pie the final look is grest.

I also made the recipe from Joe's Stone Crabs . I am also going to retype it so it's more recent: Use same almond/graham cracker crust as above. For filling, combine 6 egg yolks with 2 cans sweetened condensed milk (one can of low fat works fine). Add 1 cup of key lime juice and 1 tsp lime zest. Blend well, bake at 375 for 10-15 minutes. Refrigerate at least 4 hours. I wanted to cut down on the fat so I made the meringue rather than using the whipped cream. Then I served with a low fat frozen Vanilla yogurt and garnished with mint leaves. Very yummy and pretty too! Enjoy!!

Like most of the other reviewers here, I am actually rating the VA recipe with the crust for the recipe on this page. One small tip--make sure that you don't overbrown the almonds, since they get a little more heat when you put the pie in.

I've been using this recipe for quite some time now and I really enjoy it. The only substitution I make is to make the crust from the "Old-fashioned Lime Pie" recipe also on this website. It's made with vanilla wafers and butter and it is a great blend with this very simple filling. I love it. I think one of these reviewers meant to review the other key lime recipe as there is no cream cheese in this recipe.

Points to consider: 1. the recipe given is an abberation. key lime pie MUST contain key lime juice and BY NO MEANS may contain cream cheese!!!! 2. use the VA reviewer's recipe. it is excellent. be sure to use key lime juice and zest, NOT lime juice and zest. key lime juice is akin to a rich lemon juice and nothing like lime juice. if you don't have access to key limes, don't try to make key lime pie.

I made the pie as a special request from my son for Thanksgiving and clearly something was wrong. I purchased the key lime juice from Williams Sonoma and used a pre made crust.

Check the reviews and use the Miami recipe from reviewer from VA. This IS the real Key West Pie. You can use your choice of crust. BUT Never, Never use egg whites on top. Whipped cream is the way to go. The only thing better is being in Key West at sunset with a piece of pie.

This is very easy but I think the meringue makes it too sweet! Perhaps the whipped topping would help with that. I also didn't put all of the sugar into the crust when using graham crackers - again - too much sweetness. I also used the non-fat sweetened condensed milk and it was fine.

I haven't tried this particular key lime pie recipe, but when I make key lime pie and similar recipes that call for uncooked egg whites, all I do is make an Italian meringue. All you have to do is make a simple syrup and boil it for a few minutes. Then pour it into the egg white mixture SLOWLY (while beating continuosly with an electric mixer). This should bring the egg whites up to the proper temp. Good luck.

I make this recipe in a tart pan that is wider and spread the filling thinner. So 15 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees does cook it. Be careful not to dry it out by overcooking.

I followed the recipe given by the reviewer RAISAB from GAINESVILLE VA (Joe's Stone Crab recipe). Ever since I had the pie at Joe's Stone Crabs in Miami, I've been searching for a key lime pie recipe. I didn't have key limes, so I used a 50-50 mix of fresh persian lime juice and fresh lemon juice with lime zest (no lemon zest). The results were beautiful, a silky smooth filling. A tart and very refreshing pie that was reminiscent of my meal at Joe's Stone Crabs in Miami. My wife is begging me to make this again (and soon).

Some people have expressed concern about the use of raw eggs in the recipe. Fear not, the acid content of the lime juice is enough to effectively 'cook' the eggs. As long as the pie is allow to chill in the fridge before serving (I would make it at least a few hours ahead), you do not need to cook it at all. Skip the topping and add whipped cream. Whipped cream, or nothing at all, would be the traditional topping. Before making this recipe you should be aware that Key Limes are very different from regular limes. Key Limes are very tart and their juice is a pale yellow, not green. Although a regular lime pie would probably be tasty, lemons would make a better substitution if you cannot find Key Limes. Remember: If it's green, it's not a REAL Key lime pie!

I'm afraid I wouldn't try this recipe due to the samonella bacteria that raw eggs present. And I doubt that the baking of the merangue would sufficiently cook the egg enough. I would be extremely careful with using raw eggs in any recipe, particularly if feeding it to young children, pregnant women or those with weakened immune systems. I would like to find out more about pasturized eggs as mentioned by a fellow reviewer.

This pie was terrific. The crust is divine, and the filling is delicious...I highly recommend it to anyone!

Too sweet, not tart enough. The crust was very tasty, but not for this pie. Meringue topping is not really appropriate for a Key Lime Pie.

This is a great recipe! I used it in Saipan, CNMI. My sister has a very sour orange growing in her back yard. I used the juce from that instead of the Key Lime juice and Macadamias instead of Almonds. It was fantastic! I call it Saipan Orange Pie.

I've made this recipe many times since reading about it in Gourmet years ago. It's always a hit. The crust is wonderful. This is the perfect late-summer dessert.

I made this recipe several years ago and plan to make it again very soon for a key lime pie fan. The crumb-based almond crust was particularly good; superior to the typical "regular" pie crust one would expect to find with key lime pie.

I question the safety of this recipe. The merangue acts as a insulator, when being browned I doubt the eggs are even being baked.

Everyone had room for this light, delicious desert among many choices, even after a holiday meal. I found the meringue is golden in 10 minutes. Blending the graham crackers together with almonds in food processor improved the texture of the crust the second time I made it.

This pie is wonderful! I made it for a dinner party and everybody just raved about it.

Just one more comment on the egg issue... you can buy flash pasturized egg whites. I get them in the egg section of my local grocery.

In response to previous review of raw egg concern, I feel certain that the cooking time is sufficient to cook eggs properly. The pie is delicious & very easy.

As there are uncooked egg yolks in this recipe, I wonder if it is safe from salmonella (food poisoning) which is present in many of our eggs today. I didn't make it for that reason as I'm not sure.
