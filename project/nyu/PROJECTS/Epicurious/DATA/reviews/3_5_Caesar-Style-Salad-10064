Was loking for a low fat alternative to our much loved Caesar Salad addiction, this one serves purpose. Creamy, I added a little more anchovie paste and garlic,I used Greek Plain Non fat yogurt and no one could tell. They loved it, will make it all the time.

I was anxious to use the 'oh so powerful' anchovies, I'm not really an anchovy fan but LOVE Caesar dressing. Made this, substituted balsamic (I think a little heavy for the recipe) for red wine vinegar. Left out the red onion as well - its not necessary. Great dressing, can't tell its healthy or lowfat at all. Maybe I'm the only one that thinks that a salad dressing shouldn't be based on mayo....The use of yogurt is great.

A good recipe and a nice change from the same old, same old... I didn't mash the garlic, I instead just put it into the food processor with the rest of the ingredients, and I used white balsamic. A keeper.

Served this salad (doubled the recipe) to a group and it was gone! I used the Greek syle fat free yogurt which is very thick and rich tasting. I omitted the red onion and I used croutons. Also, used anchovies instead of the paste. No one could believe it was so low fat. Will make this often!

Wonderful! I'm always on the lookout for good, lowfat/cal salad dressings, and think this is great! I double the recipe and make it about once a week. I also use fish sauce instead of anchovies, and often add fresh cooked large shrimp to make it a dinner salad.

My family and I thought this was delicious! Must admit, I added 1/2 cup light mayo, then doubled the rest of the ingredients (except DON'T double the salt, and I used 3 packaged romaine hearts instead of one head). I also added croutons (you could use fat-free) and didn't use the onion (spicy enough already with the garlic and dijon, plus I added LOTS of freshly ground black pepper) FURTHERMORE I didn't use a Cuisinart, I just mixed everything in a bowl with a spatula.

A great dish to make with pantry staples. I often add rotisserie chicken or a can of tuna to make it more substantial. I've even used low-fat mayo instead of yogurt and used it as a sandwich spread or dip for crudites.

I served this at a dinner party and no one knew that it wasn't the traditional Caesar. I substituted Fish Sauce for the anchovies since I use that a lot in my own cooking but wouldn't know what to do with the leftover anchovies the recipe calls for. I also diced up some bacon bits to further enhance the flavor. Just make sure you don't add as much salt if you choose this option.

I've already made this countless times. My family isn't big on anything lean or green but they polished off this salad in minutes! No complaints!

I just made the dressing today and it is awesome. I haven't even chilled it yet! I'm sure it'll be even better on the salad tomorrow. The yogurt makes it quite tangy and since I couldn't find anchovy paste, I just mashed regular anchovies with the garlic and salt with a mortar & pestle.

My husband hates caesar salad but liked this one. Very Very Good!

I have been making this salad since I first saw it in the Gourmet issue. It is great! Healthful and delicious. I've prepared grilled chicken Caesar salad numerous times for a summer dinner. I do have to add sliced red onion whenever I make a Caesar salad--just my own preference.

My husband said "This is VERY GOOD" ... and I didn't even use anchovy paste cos I didn't have any.I certainly agree.

A great recipe for those watching their weight. My husband, who is not, loved it as well.

This recipe is great! It's as good as any caesar salad I've had in a restaurant and it's much healthier! I make up the dressing on weekends and have the salad for or with dinner after work during the week. Buying prewashed romaine in a bag makes preparation especially quick.

I served this at a dinner party and nobody realized how low-fat this salad was until I told them. This salad is full of flavor and is perfect for someone who counts the fat grams.
