I was amazed how dense these brownies turned out, which was rather nice. However, they lacked enough peanut butter flavor and there needed to be more definition between the flavors, it melded into one taste. I wasn't impressed with the result.

We loved these brownies. They are very rich and delicious. My only complaint is that there could have been stronger peanut butter flavor and I had problems doing the swirl.

A yummy recipe. Nice and chocolatey with a hint of peanut butter. Brownies are rather dense by nature. Light and fluffy is for cakes, or such is our opinion. Use your artistic talents to turn a potentially ugly product into a creative endeavor.

Too heavy and not enough peanut butter flavor. They were ok but nothing to rave about
