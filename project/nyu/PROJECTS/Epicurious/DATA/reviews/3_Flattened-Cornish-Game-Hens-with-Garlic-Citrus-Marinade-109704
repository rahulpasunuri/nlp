I liked this a lot. Easy marinade and flavorful. I didn't have lime, so it was all lemon. I added the juice of the lemon as well. Delicious!

I agree with JR1977, this was great! It wasn't bland at all. The flavor of the hens came through, but the marinade added a very nice touch. It was a hit and we will have it again. It is an easy meal, but also elegant and would be good for company.

Marinade had great smells - thought flavor would be seeped in - but was almost nonexistent. Maybe increase the marinating time to 1 hour..?? I used a pan that has raised grill portions on the stove and it worked well. Use a thermometer when cooking as mine took a little longer than the recommended time. Not a total waste of time -- we all ate it.

I truly don't know why this recipe has received so many negative/average reviews. I have been making this recipe since the summer of 2004 when came across it in my monthly Bon Appetit. My wife loves it. I have made it for many family and friends all of whom loved it and all of them are candid enough to tell me otherwise! I wouldn't call the flavor "bland." You can taste the citrus, thyme and garlic; it just doesn't rob the dish of it's natural grilled chicken flavor. I don't believe a marinade should so alter the flavor of a pice of poultry or meat so as to make the intrinsic flavor of the beef/bird undetectable. This dish quickly and easily accomplishes the goal of putting forth an impressive looking dish with enough accent flavor to make it interesting while leaving behind that incomparable grilled chicken flavor enjoyed on our few (I'm from Chicago) but glorious of hot summer nights.

I wish I had read the reviews before making this dish. I was surprised at how bland it was. The chicken didn't seem to absorb any of the flavor. Very disappointing.

Wasn't crazy about this one. Kept adding spices to liven it up but in ultimatly unimpressed. Does work fine for rice and veggies, tho

We also found the recipe to be a little bland. The chicken was very juicy and smelled wonderful, but the meat didn't seem to absorb much of the flavor. I had added a bit of extra garlic and the juice from the lemon and lime I grated and also rubbed it under the skin well but it still was bland. The juices seemed to flavor the veggies I served more than the chicken. Not bad, but I wouldn't make it again.

This was very easy but a bit mild. I added 1 tsp ground chipolte pepper, 1 tsp. fine herbes seasoning, 1T lime juice and omitted salt for bbq. It was very tasty and provided a nice presentation. Appetizer was shrimp & mange receipe. Main course was served with wild rice and thyme, green beans with sesame seeds. Nice aged chardonnay was perfect.

bland. even added extra zest and some red hot pepper flakes.also salt in marinade causes juices to run out of meat.

With no access to a grill, we roasted the hen in the oven (425 degrees for 25 minutes), and didn't bother to flatten. Came out very juicy, and the marinade had great flavor (delicious pan juices in the roasting pan, as well). I recommend using half again as much of citrus zest and garlic as called for. Next time I'll add some lemon juice to the marinade as well. I may also use this with chicken parts, so it can be rubbed under the skin (hard to do on a little game hen!).
