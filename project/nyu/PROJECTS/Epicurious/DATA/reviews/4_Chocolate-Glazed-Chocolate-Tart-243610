This is super easy and makes an impressive showing. Next time, I'd top it with so homemade flavored whipped cream to mellow the intense chocolate. Also, I did make a traditional graham cracker crust instead of chocolate.

Made this for an auction and it was surprisingly easy to make. I used Callebaut 56% bittersweet, and it was perfect. A trivial issue, but I wish I had made the crust extend higher up the side of the pan, rather than just 3/4", since the filling was level with the crust and I like the way the picture looks instead, with the crust extending up past the filling. See, I told you it was trivial, but when making for an auction, appearances really matter. I decorated it by piping small rosettes of whipped cream (stabilized with Whip It) around the edge and candied violets. It turned out really nice. The glossy glaze really makes it look elegant. I'll definitely make this again.

WARNING: Death by chocolate! This tart can be cut into many more than 8-10 pieces. I used Ghiradelli 60% cacao. I was very happy that I served this with fresh cut strawberries because the tart itself is SO rich!! The tart paired nicely with the Merlot I had served with dinner.

This was a hit at the family Christmas party. All 18 guests gave it a two thumbs up! I have made this several times and it always is a crowd pleaser. I think it is fine even if you make it the day before with the glaze.

I would make it again, but I think I'd use a less bitter chocolate. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet (60%) chips. I think my guests would have prefered a sweeter version of this recipe. I served it with vanilla ice cream, which I think helped balance out the bitterness.

As at least one reviewer notes, the chocolate graham crackers are hard to find. After four years I found them at Walmart...a family-oriented store and therefore a logical source. I used Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chocolate and unlike another reviewer got RAVES for this.

Wish I'd followed the advice of the previous reviewer. I used Ghirardelli 60% Bittersweet Chocolate baking chips. It looked lovely, the texture was perfect, but guests took a bite and left the rest. One of them asked if I'd maybe forgotten to add sugar. It was just too bitter.A blue ribbon recipe? Not when it ends up in the trash.

Rating: 4
I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it about 5 or 6 times and each time it gets RAVE reviews. I always use the Lindt 50%. Anything higher than the 50% is too bitter (regardless of the fact that we actually prefer to eat 70-80% dark chocolate everyday). It's such an easy recipe that it's my go to elegant dinner dessert recipe.

Rating: 0
This is fantastic recipe. Here's what you need to change (lol). Use Nabisco Famous Chocolate Wafers for more intense crust ( 1 cup). Use Scharffen Berger chocolate (62%,convenient 9 oz bar). For the glaze try Ghiardelli's Intense Dark Sea Salt Soiree Bar or the Intense Dark Hazelnut Heaven Bar. Oh Boy !!!!!!

This tart is so good I want to punch someone when I eat it. It is fabulous and super, super rich, which reminds me of my only tip for someone making this: since it is 95% chocolate, buy the good stuff if you can! Also keep in mind when you are eating it and serving it that it is almost pure chocolate, because I saw some really ambitious people at the party I made it for take large slices, and then I laughed at them because they had no idea what they were getting themselves into. ANYWAY, the point is, this is fantastic, and not a single person seemed to think otherwise.

OMG is right. If you love chocolate, this is definitely THE dessert! Its aesthetic impressiveness and exquisite taste belies the simplicity of the recipe. I increased the glaze by 50% and it seemed to be the perfect amount. When pouring the glaze, work fast because it sets up very quickly. Served with fresh whipped cream and raspberries. Delicious!

This was a choco-dream! I am normally much more into savories than sweets, but this was reaaaallllyyyy good. My guests said it was the best chocolate dessert they ever had! Also very simple. Overall, a huge bang for your buck in all respects. I did use a regular graham crust, as I don't like the flavor of chocolate ones, and I think it was a good choice.

Made this tart for a self-proclaimed chocoholic in my book group, who made yet another proclamation: "Extraordinary!" Also tried it with a grind of smoked sea salt on top - yummy, but for me it took away from the velvety texture of the truffle-like filling.

Absolutely delicious. Super easy to make too. I can't wait to make it again for a dinner party! I made it with a glass pie plate because that's all I had, but I will now invest in a real tart pan so that I can make it again and have it look a little nicer.

I was drawn to this recipe by it's high reviews and easy of assembly (I'm a pretty good cook, but baking's not my strong suit). I followed the recipe exactly with one exception...I added one teaspoon of instant espresso powder to the egg mixture before adding it to the melted chocolate, since I know how coffee enhances to flavor of chocolate. This tart is so divine, pairs so well with port, and really is not difficult to make at all. This is my new "go to" dessert for dinner parties!

Rating: 4
A terrific recipe. I did not improvise and it was a complete hit at the family Christmas party. Amazing that anything can be that rich and delicious without adding additional sugar. I will invest in a 9 inch fluted tar pan since the 10 inch one stretched the crust a bit.

This recipe literally blew me away, it was that good and it definitely exceeded my expectations. I chose to make this for thanksgiving because I am a chocolate fiend and needed a chocolatey dessert to compliment all of the other pies and cakes I had made. I wanted something simple and not too labor intensive, so I chose this one. Basically I didn't really expect too much of the recipe but man, oh man, was I surprised. Even though I would only recommend eating a sliver at a time, it is so good that I almost wish I would have made two so that I could have had some leftovers for myself. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of bittersweet because that is what I had on hand and I also used chocolate teddy bear grahams for the crust instead of traditional graham crackers because that was the only thing I could find at the store. I would highly recommend making this recipe!

This recipe is extremely simple to make and fine restaurant quality! I've used this recipe numerous times for dessert auctions and it always brings the big bucks! I decorate with fresh whipped cream dots topped with raspberries around the edge. It is such a rich dessert that I usually cut it into 16 slices - sliced for 8 would about kill you (and I am a chocolate fiend). It is a favorite!

This is a wonderful amazing chocolate tart. Pretty much coma inducing. I was a little hesitant about how it would all turn out, not knowing how the filling would go from being liquid to holding its shape when it was cut. Also, I'd never used a graham cracker crust before (not a French thing to do) but it ended up wonderfully. The pieces came out holding their shape perfectly and it tasted like heaven. The thing is, if you don't like dark chocolate, you probably won't like the tart. Maybe milk chocolate would work? Last thing: also incredibly easy to make. Just use a blender to turn the crackers to crumbs or you'll be there for hours. =)

I don't know how many times I've made this -- a zillion? It is the best chocolate tart I've ever eaten...or made. Since chocolate graham crackers aren't available here (Berlin), I use Leibniz plain butter crackers and add a bunch of pure cocoa powder and a pinch (I mean, a PINCH) of sugar. I also used 70% and 80% cacao with excellent results. Just wowser.

This was amazing; and really easy. I have eaten it cold and room temperature and it was equally good. Got the graham crackers at Vons (Safeway); they carried storebrand only. They are ok plain (my kids eat the leftovers) and great in the dessert. A huge hit and an easy make ahead and a great addition to the dessert table at a party.

This was very good but very rich. A lot of people liked it when i made this but it was not a hug hit. I couldnt find chocolate grahm crumbs so i used Oreo which was good but I had to add more the the crust because it was too wet. Also, next time I might use semisweet instead of bittersweet or just use the bitter but add some milk chocolate as i felt it was not sweet enough.

The chocolate filling was wonderful, smooth and rich, however, the chocolate graham crackers made the tart have an unpleasant grainy texture. I would make this again but use chocolate wafers or some other chocolate crust recipe.

Ever since I discovered this recipe in January it is my go to recipe for a drop dead impressive dessert for guests! It is truly fine restaurant quality! I used 60% cacao Ghiradelli chips (run through the food processor) and HyTop chocolate graham crackers since none of our stores had honeymaid. The food processor makes quick work of the crackers. So easy, so decadent, so rich! I cut the tart into 16 pieces (32 if serving with another dessert) since it is so rich. Topped with dollops of fresh whipped cream and either fresh raspberries or strawberries it makes a gorgeous presentation. The tarts have gone $80+ at dessert auctions I've donated it for. It's fabulous!

Even if you mess up each and every stage of this recipe, you will still have a legendary tart at the table. Nothing went right with my baking this tart (all my fault!) - I overcooked it, my measurement conversions were suspect, I used whichever cream and biscuits I could find...plus for the glaze, with corn syrup being unavailable in European supermarkets, I had to use some other recipe with gelatin, loads of sugar etc which I also messed up. Nevertheless, EVERYBODY including my suuuuuper picky Dad who only buys the best patisserie tarts for dessert, loved it (I loved the flavour, texture etc but am lactose intolerant so paid for my indulgence that very evening).

When a recipe as such good review I am always wondering if it's justify. This one was! What makes me love this pie even more; so easy to do on top of it. It is great. The key is certainly to use good quality chocolate, the taste is strong and you don't need big slices.

Chocolate truffle pie! Or as my husband described it, two chocolate bars held together with heavy cream and eggs. This is sensational - luscious, creamy rich chocolate - with relatively little effort. The food processor made quick work of the crust. I used the stores brand of chocolate animal graham crackers, but will use Nabisco chocolate wafers next time for more chocolate flavor and less grainy graham flour. I used a quiche pan, which made removing the first slice challenging, but eliminated the problem of melted butter leaking in the oven. I doubled the glaze, as others suggested, and was glad I did. It wasnt perfectly smooth, so Ill increase the corn syrup next time. The tart was delicious with whipped cream. Next time Ill experiment with substituting liqueur for the vanilla and warm water, and in the whipped cream. Others have indicated this is best at room temp, but we found it too soft and pudding- y. I refrigerated the leftovers, and the texture was much better.

Holy chocolate! This was gooooood. I am kind of an impatient cook, but this is well worth the time. It seriously tastes like a big truffle, so I suggest serving it with ice cream. Mine was not nearly as beautiful as the picture, so I added some fresh raspberries on the top to disguise my mistakes. Also, my crust definitely needed more butter, it was a tad crumbly. I might make a raspberry sauce next time I make it since the berries were such a big hit. Try this!

Ok, all together now: TO. DIE. FOR!! I made this as a test recipe for a dessert auction, and everyone about passed out because it was sooooo luscious! Deep, rich, dark chocolate! I used Ghiradelli 65% bittersweet baking pieces, had a little trouble finding the chocolate grahams - no honeymade choc grahams to be found at our regular grocery stores, but found Hytop brand at Winco. Worked great! SO VERY EASY, and tastes like you slaved all day - or purchased it from the fancy bakery in the swanky shopping center. To boost the "curb appeal" for the dessert auction I piped homemade whipped cream rosettes around the circle and placed a raspberry on each - lovely! Fetched $55 dollars at the auction. And it tastes like a million!!

This was very yummy and rich. I could not find chocolate grahams at my local market so I substituted a chocolate graham cracker crust. I would not recommend doing this or, if you do, use only a small amount of the butter. The crust turned into a melted mess when I cooked it and I had to re-press it up the sides of the tart pan. Still tasted great but caused a little mid-recipe stress.

A chocolate lovers delight. Just like everyone else said, easy and delicious. I only had a 10 inch pan so I upped everything by a smidge and it worked perfect. Also, when watching for "filling set 3 inches out" I was looking for a noticable difference, but realized when I touched the top there was no visual sign of that "3 inches" so use touch to see. Mine appeared to be set all the way through, but it still tasted great.

Made this for a wedding gift for chocolate lovers. Used a pre-made Keebler chocolate graham crust. I crumbled the crust, mixed with melted butter and used a regular nine inch pie plate, as I did not have a tart pan and the pie plate was part of the gift. Pre-baked the crust, per directions on recipe. Baked about 23 minutes and it was perfect. Doubled the glaze, per other reviewers suggestions and it was perfect, beautiful, just like the photo here! It tasted OUTSTANDING, too!!! Will make again and again!

I made this recipe for Christmas, along with a strawberry torte. Although this was very good, the strawberry torte was by far everyone's favorite. This dish is very heavy and dense, almost like eating fudge. And the crust was a little bit crumbly, like it needed a bit more butter. We'll make it again, but I'll serve it after a lighter meal and not a heavy Christmas dinner. The flavor was great. Would be nice topped with whipped cream to break up the chocolate flavor. I might add some pecans to the crust just to add another flavor dimension. It turned out very pretty and was easy to make.

It was simply incredible. Due to a mix-up at the grocery store, I used half bittersweet chocolate and half milk chocolate - it was like eating a crunchy-silky truffle in pie form. The tart was eaten in its entirety on the night I served it. At my guests' request, I will make the tart again for our holiday dinner.

This looked so good, I decided to make it for Thanksgiving. The tart came out so well it looked as the picture. I had trouble finding chocolate grahams, so I bought a pre- made chocolate graham crust and simply mixed in the remaining ingredients. Here is where I had the problem...when I baked the crust, it dripped on to the bottom of the oven and caused so much smoke. I used the tart pan with the removable bottom and I guess that is where the leak occurred. Otherwise it was perfect!

Wow! This is so delicious, smooth, decadent, and easy. My only issue was that my crust was too hard. I used whole foods brand chocolate teddy grahams. I doubled it to fit my regular springform pan (no tart pan). Next time, I'll try something different or not cook it as long on a lower temp. like another reviewer. Also, whole foods does not have corn syrup. I tried it with lundberg's brown rice syrup, which actually worked out in shine and flavor but I couldn't get it nearly as smooth as the photo. Regardless this was delicious and very refined. *I used 62% mint infused organic chocolate for the glaze and 54% for the filling. The hint of mint was amazing! Perfect for the holidays.

Our planned dessert for Thanksgiving fell through, so I was looking for a last minute replacement and found this one. It was easy to make and got raves at the table. For those having trouble with the crust, 9 choc. graham crackers is one packet (4.8 oz, 136 g). I got slightly more than 1c of crumbs and used them all, so try going by weight instead of volume if you didn't have enough crust. If you use chocolate wafers instead of grahams, use the pie crust recipe from Nabisco's website to get the right amount of butter: 22 FAMOUS Chocolate Wafers, finely crushed (about 1-2/3 cups crumbs) 1/4 cup sugar 3 Tbsp. butter, softened

Rating: 2
not sure where I could have gone wrong aside from my springform tart pan being about 10" rather than the 9". The crust didn't adhere to the cake - and the glaze didn't come out as it looked in the picture which is what I had expected - it was duller. This was good in flavor but not great.

This is incredible - very, very rich, and the inside is wonderfully creamy. Made it for a dinner party, and guests raved about it and literally stole pieces off each others' plates. I followed the recipe, except: - the second time I made this, I cooked the crust for 8 mins at 225 - turned out better than the longer cooking time indicated in the recipe. The crust can get very hard and burn easily. - I added orange peel to the crust, and to the glaze - worked great with the chocolate, and tasted especially good the next day. - I added twice as much corn syrup to the glaze - its easier to spread if slightly runnier. I served this with a very orange whipped cream (fresh juice, and finely grated peel, heated with sugar, cooled, and slowly mixed with whipped cream). The light, fresh, fruity cream complimented the darkness of the chocolate very well. Will definitely be making again.

I contributed this for a dinner party held by a friend for 20 and it was greeted with total rapture! I followed the recipe exactly except that here in Sydney Australia we dont have graham crackers so I used plain digestive biscuits and they worked a treat.

Exceptionally delicious and VERY easy to make. This is an incredibly forgiving dessert.

Insanely good, especially for the effort (or lack thereof) involved. I was a little disappointed with the crust - I used Newman's chocolate letter cookies and found the crust to be a little crumbly, barely enough to cover the pan, and not at all photogenic compared to the rest of the tart. The glaze is gorgeous. I had just enough glaze as written. I chose to infuse the cream with lavender, which added a nice dimension. I used 72% bittersweet chocolate (Guittard), but did 7 oz balanced by 2 oz milk chocolate for the filling which helped me avoid any possible bitterness. The mouthfeel on the filling is AMAZING. Really lovely. Served it with a lavender honey infused whipped cream.

I also substituted 1/4 cup of espresso for 1/4 cup of the cream in the filling and added 2-3 tbsp sugar (to counter the bitterness of the coffee). Fantastic! I made a second one for myself since the first one got demolished by my colleagues at work... A keeper.

Excellent. I decided to make this tart for a fundraising event, made one to dry-run the recipe and work out any kinks... Ended up making 2 more, one just as the recipe states, the second, taking a suggestion from another reviewer, added orange zest to the finished crust, made the standard filling, then using Lindor orange chocolate, made the glaze. Wow, added a whole new dimension to it. I'll be making this often. One change I made, bake the tart at 325 degrees for 25 minutes, the inside needs to be slightly gooey.

Easy, doesn't take long, & soooo delicious. Made it for a potluck, and at least 2 people said they don't usually like desserts but wanted more & more of this. A small slice goes a long way, so this tart probably serves more like 8-10 adults. Served with unsweetened whipped cream & fresh berries. Also used Amaretto instead of water in the glaze, & like other reviewers couldn't really taste it, but that's ok. Was grateful for the reviewers' tips saying to work fast with the glaze while it's warm. I used Annie's chocolate bunny grahams for the crust, & that was fine. Used Cordillera 59% bittersweet chocolate bought at Whole Foods, and that was great. Also used organic heavy cream, which I think also makes a huge contribution to the flavor. Yummmmm. I'll be making this again for sure!

I really enjoyed this. I had a gathering with women that are on a no to low sugar/ no carb diet. This was perfect. I made a pecan crust (pecans, butter and no sugar) and I didn't make the glaze. It was still wonderful! I used 6 oz semi sweet (54%) and 3 oz 100% of bakers chocolate. I'm sure it could have been out of this world if I had used better quality chocolate...I really like rich desserts because then I don't eat as much! :) It was very good and made for a nice presentation.

I made this for a group of friends on Valentine's day, but had to make a number of changes to fit what I had on hand--mostly substituting cocoa powder (w/butter and sugar) for chocolate. I also don't have a tart pan, having recently moved, nor a food processor for finely grinding those crackers. Still, it came our pretty fantastically, and when my already full friends had as much as they could, I left it in the communal area on my floor for others. It was gone in no time flat and I've gotten gotten a number of compliments and recipe requests from people on the floor. It makes me want to go by a tart pan so I can make one as pretty as the one in the picture.

Excellent, rich tart. Wish I had read all of the reviews first and made more glaze (recipe amount is barely enough and needs to quickly go on warm to get perfectly smooth top). Here's an idea for the busy cook not tried by prior reviewers. I bought a preformed Nabisco chocolate graham cracker crust. Just crumbled it up and added half the amount of butter and sugar. Delicious although it was only enough to go halfway up the side of the fluted tart pan (pan is a must for the gorgeous looks). Also bought the Nabisco Teddy Grahams like others did but I didn't like the lighter color (great taste though). Used these to make 2 extra 5" tarts since I had extra filling. Considered the Nabisco chocolate wafers but these were very expensive relative to preformed crust or Teddy Grahams. Next time I will try some of the liquor ideas to jazz it up. A great recipe!

Rating: 4
Loved this tart! Had to adjust the time and temp downward for my convection oven but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. Nabisco now makes a variety of flavord graham crackers, including chocolate, so they weren't hard to find. I made the tart the night before my party and took it out of the fridge the next morning. Glazed it after it sat out for an hour or so and left it alone for a few hours. It was perfect. I wouldn't hesitate to make this in advance and glaze it when ready for use.

If I were to make this early in the day for a dinner party that night, should I put it in the fridge and glaze later in the afternoon or evening or just leave the glazed tart out of the fridge. May not be served for several hours. I'd like to have it all ready before guests arrive for dinner. Thanks!

This tart was so easy and so delicious! It looked and tasted like a professional made it and I'm no baker! The only changes I made to the recipe was that I used milk and bittersweet chocolate for the glaze based off of a suggestion from another review I read on this site and I used a 9 inch spring-form pan instead of a fluted tart pan. (It still looked great). I put the rest of the tart in the fridge when my party was over and although the glaze lost its shine when it got cold, eating the tart on the 2nd day was even better...it tasted like thick fudge. Soooo good! I will definitely be making this again and sharing the recipe with my choco- holic friends!

OMG. So good! I increased the crust and the glaze a little since I have an 11" tart pan. No problems with the glaze - I just used the back of a spoon to spread it to the edges and let it firm up in the fridge for an hour, and it was gorgeous. I also garnished it with a border of toasted hazelnuts. Totally amazing. Gone in 10 minutes. How soon can I make it again?

This was excellent! I am a huge chocolate fan (who isn't?), so I was excited from the get-go to make this. It is not very difficult to make, and the graham cracker crust is delicious with the intense chocolate flavor. I do agree with another reviewer, however, who mentioned that this is extremely rich - a glass of milk might be necessary! cookingforoneinparis.blogspot.com

It came out just "ok".. but I think It was the chocolate. I got 64% dark chocolate from Whole Foods and my boyfriend said it was a bit bland. I will try one of the suggestions and use part bitter sweet and milk chocolate to see what happens.. It looks great at least and is very easy to make

OH MY GOODNESS! I do not have a sweet tooth or really like sweets. A co-worker made this for me as a surprise. I about died! I asked for the recipe and he sent me here. You half to crazy not to LOVE this Pie. Now I need a big glass of milk.

I have made this several times according the recipie and it turns out perfect every time. As a variation on the theme, I steeped dried tart cherries in Chambord for two days, added the ichor to the cream and the cherries onto the crust before adding the filling. I also added Chambord to the glaze. It was exquisite. I did add a tablespoon of flour to the filling to compensate for the added liquid. Turned out fantastic and was loved by all.

I made this tart a few days ago. It was very easy to make and it looked just like the picture. I didn't want it to be too bitter, so I used 4.5 ounces of bittersweet chocolate and 4.5 ounces of milk chocolate for the filling. I like chocolate, but this was too much for me. One of my friends who is a chocolate lover ranted and raved about how good this tart was and wanted me to make her one on the spot.

I made this again using milk chocolate. I sliced strawberries and put them on top. It was wonderful! I used teddy grahams again for the crust. But this time when I baked the tart, butter from the crust leaked our all over the bottom. I think I made the crumbs too fine! But it did not affect the taste. I still want to do a mint version, and I saw someone mention a peanut butter version! Yummy!

This recipe is a definite keeper. I used chocolate wafers as I could not find chocolate graham crackers as others have stated. I was worried that the teddy grahams would be too sweet. The chocolate wafers worked very well. I added fresh raspberries in a ring around the top as a garnish and served it with whipped cream. It was easy and quick to make and received rave reviews all the way around. This tart will show up on our table again soon.

This is a chocolate lover's dream come true! I, like many of the other reviewers, had trouble finding chocolate graham crackers, so I used chocolate Teddy Grahams. They were easy to process into crumbs and made a perfect crust. The texture, the richness, the ease of making, and the pure "chocolateness" of this dessert makes it a keeper!

It is not often I find an elegant, delicious, and EASY dessert recipe like this one. It was beautiful and so good! I used chocolate wafer cookies for the crust, and I used 1 1/2 cups of them because I could not find the graham crackers called for and they grind up much finer. I also did not have any problems with the glaze. It was the perfect amount. I will be making this often!

This tart is INSANE. I made it for a small dinner party last night and it will now be my go-to dessert for entertaining - it's easy, gorgeous, and incredibly delicious! I agree with the other reviewers that the crust wasn't enough to go up the sides - I used it only on the bottom and it was great. I couldn't find chocolate graham crackers, so I used Newman's Own chocolate alphabet cookies, and they worked great. I also used simple syrup instead of corn syrup. Finally, I sprinkled a little sea salt on top before serving. Magnifique!

Rating: 4
Each bite of this pie was like eating a chocolate truffle. I definitely recommend cutting it into small slices. The only change I made was to crush up more chocolate grahams, as the 1 cup recommended didn't cover the bottom and sides of my tart pan. Otherwise, I made it exactly as stated. Delicious and so rich!

Super easy and delicious. It took me no time to put this tart together. I could not find chocolate graham crackers so I substituted chocolate wafers (like oreos without the filling) -- no problem. Great.

Absolutely incredible! Made exactly the way the recipe stated and it was just perfect. I used a 9" tart pan, and my husband and I thought there was plenty of crust! The smooth filling is to die for (used Guittard's 60% bittersweet cacao chips, chopped) and the glaze added an elegance for presentation. My husband suggested a peanut butter glaze NEXT time I make this (we both LOVE choc/peanut butter flavor, combined) so will try it, again, and substitute peanut butter chips for choc. chips.

This is the second time I make this and I couldn't find chocolate graham wafers but did have Oreo crumbs on hand -- bad idea! There's already lots of fat in the Oreo crumbs and the melted butter leaked out the bottom of the plate and made a huge mess of my oven. Smoke everywhere. (Yes, I know I should have put it on a cookie sheet -- you can be sure I will from now on!) I started over with regular graham wafer crumbs and it's just as good in my opinion. In fact, you could skip the crust and just serve the filling ;-)

A truly decadent dessert-- not for the faint of chocolate! Trader Joe's 17 oz of dark chocolate (50%ish) was only $3.99 and made a perfect tasting chocolate with plenty to spare. Also increased crust recipe to at least 1.5 times original recipe. Going back for another slice...

Rating: 0
hi there, cook from san francisco (12/18/08) ::: i experimented with a slightly higher cacao percentage i think it was about 70% to 75%. at this percentage the tart had an overriding tangy/sour and bitter taste. chilling the tart dampened the tang a bit but it was still present. hope that helps a bit.

I made this for Christmas this year and it was a hit! Decadent and delicious. I recommend making the crust recipe 1.5 times the original amount, however, because the 9-graham cracker crust isn't quite enough.

Outstanding dessert-- the results belie the effort. I made everything but the glaze before Christmas, then glazed it Christmas morning. I substituted Bailey's With a Hint of Coffee for the water in the glaze, and topped with a little unsweetened whipped cream.

Why does this recipe stipulate "bittersweet chocolate not more than 65% cacao if marked." Will it not work correctly if you use, say, 100% or will it just be too bitter. Can you mix some 100% with lesser percent to bring downt he total? by chocochallenged

I made this for a christmas party for my running buddies this weekend. I used Gingersnap cookies to give it some contrast. But the butter leaked too much out of the pan, causing the crust to slide off the pan a bit... i pushed it up with the back of a small spoon before the crust fully cooled. The filling and the ganache is great. i didn't get the ganache right though, it was not a perfect mirror finish, i wonder if it cooled too quickly or water wasn't the way to go? will try liquor next time. it was very good, we have 0 leftovers (now i'm sad). I made some mascarpone cream on the side. May also try earl grey or jasmine flavored whipped cream with chocolate cookie crust and heavily brewed tea for the ganache next time as well.

I have made this tart twice, both to wild acclaim (my boyfriend now requests it weekly and two of his friends asked me to marry them after tasting it). It's incredibly easy and looks amazing. Last time I made it, I decorated the top with raspberries, which complement the bittersweet chocolate nicely (and help cover up any imperfections in the glaze), and served each slice with a dollup of freshly made whipped cream. Sometimes I even dream about eating it...that's how good it is.

Rating: 3
Impossible to get the glaze to look like the picture. No idea how anyone does that. I would have given it only 2 forks (I was about to throw it away when some of my guests stopped me). But since so many of my guests seemed to like it a lot I had to do 3. I added Gran Marinier (sp?) to the glaze in place of water as one reviewer suggested and it wasn't enough. I would put some in the cake as well if I had it to do over.

Exquisite. Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. Used Nabisco Famous Chocolate wafers for the crust. Used El Ray Bucare Dark Chocolate (58%) from Whole Foods for the filling layer and Valrhona 72% for the ganache glaze because I wanted the ganache layer to be darker, both in taste and color. Added 1 1/2 tablespoons of espresso powder to the filling as well. Doubled the ganache and used 2 tablespoons of warmed Kahlua in place of the water. I did a practice tart about a week before Thanksgiving and froze some of the slices from the trial run. Defrosted them in the refrigerator, and they were just as delicious. Served the tart with a raspberry sauce drizzle and a little whipped cream.

Rating: 4
This received raves from my gourmet family this Thanksgiving (trust me, my contributions usually go unnoticed - this was amazing). I served it drizzled with a warm caramel sauce and topped with whipped cream. My only substitutions were necessity and allergy driven: Newmans Own Chocolate Alphabet Cookies for the crust (necessity), simple syrup for the corn syrup (allergy) and amaretto for the water in the glaze (okay, the last was a choice but not sure it made a huge difference to the taste). Such a simple recipe too! Make sure to allow time for the various components to cool before assembly. This is one for the family cookbook!

Even though cooks note states best day of, I thought the firmness of the leftover chilled tart the next day was even better. Sub the water for amaretto, might add a little more next time to get a more distinct flavor.

Every dark chocolate lover's dream! Surprisingly easy for a gourmet result, and so rich and flavorful. I agree with other users - next time (and there will definitely be a next time), I will try to flavor the glaze a bit with maybe a fruit liquor or coffee, just to make it stand out a bit more from the tart itself. Really and truly delicious!

O...M....G....I've made this 8 times now, and it's been an absolute eye-rolling hit each time. Some refinements that in my opinion make it perfect: 1) use a pate sucre crust, not chocolate grahams; 2) add a split vanilla bean to cream before heating; and 3) strain the filling into the crust. I use valhrona guanajo chocolate for the filling and perles for the glaze, then serve it with whipped cream sweetened lightly w/lavendar honey and a sprinkle of perles and raspberries.

Rating: 4
I'm giving it 4 forks because if you follow exactly what it says you should end up with the tart they show in the picture and the expectation. If I could make changes what would they be? I would add a liquor to the glaze just to separate the flavors from the filling, a touch of nutmeg to the crust also brings up the chocolate taste. I served it with warmed caramel, chopped almonds and raspberry whipped cream (all of them on a side) so each guest could try the tart in a different way. I think this makes at least 12 servings, since it is very rich. Will do again whenever i'm invited by a chocolate lover group =)

I made as directed, but for the crust used Newman's Own Organic Chocolate Alphabet Cookies (like oreos, but without the filling, found at Whole Foods), ground finely in the food processor. We served it with fresh raspberries & whipped cream, flavored with an orange brandy. Exquisite!

This is one of those great dishes to make to take to a dinner at someone's house- it's easy to make and looks awesome easily.

This was one of the easiest and most delicious chocolate desserts I've made in a long time! Someone suggested I use chocolate teddy grahams for the crust, and it was excellent. I also substituted a tablespoon of warmed amaretto for the water in the glaze. Served with a homemade raspberry sauce, lightly sweetened whipped cream and some fresh raspberries, this was amazingly delicious and elegant. At 22 minutes my tart was completely set all the way through, (no jiggly center whatsoever) but it was still fabulous. All in all an easy, excellent recipe that chocolate lovers will swoon over!

Easy to make and tastes as delicious as it looks. I was able to find the Nabisco chocolate graham crackers although I think they taste exactly like the Nabisco wafer cookies - either would work fine. This is very rich and definitely cures the chocolate craving. I made the tarte for a coworkers birthday; there were seven of us with plenty left over. This recipe is a keeper and should be made for your chocolate loving friends.

Tasty, easy, and great return on investment (active time to impressive-looking-ness, that is). I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips, but as I prefer the flavor of Guittard semi-sweet, I think next time I would use half Guittard and half Ghirardelli. Would definitely recommend serving this with a little sweetened whipped cream and some kind of fruit sauce.

Wow! This was so easy and so good. Used Trader Joe's chocolate animal cookies for the crust--it had a nice crunch. A dab of sweetened whipped cream on top helped to cut the richness.

This is a real winner as it is: 1. relatively easy to make, 2. Extremely delicious, and 3. looks beautiful and impressive. After reading other reviews I'm coming to believe that chocolate graham crackers do not exist. I, too, used chocolate wafers although this caused my only (minor) problem. I think if you use these the butter is off. 5 tablespoons is too much and my tart absolutely leaked butter as I was cooking the shell and after. I might try next time with 3T. I would also like to try to add a little instant espresso powder somewhere in here to kick up the chocolate flavor just a notch. Definitely serve with whipped cream, creme anglais, or dust with cocoa or powdered sugar or both. Or use a raspberry sauce to decorate the plates.

Fabulous! We love dark chocolate. I used Ghiradelli 60% bars for the chocolate. I used "famous chocolate wafers" for the crust. Next time, I may even eliminate the sugar and add more crumbs.

Didn't have a springform fluted tart pan so instead went with a traditional springform cheesecake-type pan. Worked ok, with a little bit of breakage on some of the sides - no big whoop. The tart is delish, but I would have only one mod in the future -- I think for the glaze, you can afford to go with a bit sweeter (i.e., semi-sweet) chocolate. The base is sufficiently bitter that I thought a sweeter glaze might really complement it. I also followed the suggestion of another and went for a caramel drizzle -- mmmm!

For a start, simply loved this recipe. I am married to a "choc-a-holic" and in the 20 years we have been together, this is far and away the best dessert I have made. Simple, rich, beautiful to look at with a taste to match. The only change I will make however, will be to use a higher cacao content for the glaze, probably an 85% Vahlrona and that is only because of a certain person's addiction. Four huge forks to this one.

If you like chocolate you are going to love this. Couple of things about the recipe. Chocolate Graham crackers are almost impossible to find. I used Oreo's. The amount of glaze is pretty skimy. Doubling it is usefull as is heating it in a double boiler. It cools too quickly to be able to tilt it to cover the tart.

This tart is absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe directions and made the tart a day ahead of time and glazed it the day of. If anyone has had French Silk from Sweet Nothings, this is as close as it gets except for the chocolate crust. I will be making this again and again : )
