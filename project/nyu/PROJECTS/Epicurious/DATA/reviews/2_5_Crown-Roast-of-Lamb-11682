To the previous reviewer: There are a number of variables that might have worked against you: 1) your oven leaks and/or the thermometer is off (problems that often go hand in hand); and/or 2) your lamb was older, hence bigger, and/or not prime or choice-grade (these problems also go hand in hand -- and it sounds like you might have had the "perfect storm" of problems, as I can't possibly imagine cooking a lamb roast at 425 degrees for an hour). The chefs that write these recipes tend to work with commercial-grade equipment and prime-grade meat. Lamb, in particular, varies greatly in quality. Those of us out here in the real world have to be diligent. Do not give up on crown roast of lamb - it is heavenly. Pester your butcher, and special order the meat based on his or her recommendations. It will cost a lot, but this is the quintessential special occasion main course.

I have made this roast twice. It's a fast delicious and simple meal. I added 2T of Povencal herbs to the wine sauce and didn't use a crown roast just a lamb rib, french roast (cheaper). everything else is the same. I cut the ribs and serve them separately with sauce and serve over wild rice.

It is essiential to add the beef broth, because if you don't you will have a sauce similar to Nickelodeon's slime and impossible to eat. I would not recommend this recipe for recent college grads(unless, of course, you majored in the culinary arts). My side dish of potatoes, butter, and salt did turn out though! Good Luck!
