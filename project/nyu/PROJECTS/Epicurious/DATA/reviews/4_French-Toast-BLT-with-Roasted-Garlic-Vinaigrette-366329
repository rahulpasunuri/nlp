Delicious! Vinaigrette was good...added a bit more vinegar. Great for fancy brunch. My kids loved it too...

I followed the recipe exactly. My friend enjoyed this with me and said, "That might be the best breakfast I've ever had." 'Nuff said.

This was really good but also pretty time consuming. If you are making it for brunch, I would recommend at least making the vinaigrette ahead of time. Also, I made a couple of extra slices of french toast without cheese for my kids and served it with syrup. Challah makes the best french toast ever!

So rich and delicious, you won't even need a side dish. Pretty much perfect as written!

I have not tried this recipe but it did sound very interesting, until I came to the part about the heavy cream!!! Not in my family. But I plan to try it, with 2% milk (or maybe skim).
