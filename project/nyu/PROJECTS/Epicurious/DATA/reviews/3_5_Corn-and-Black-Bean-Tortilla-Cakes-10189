Quick recipe to make from items already in the house! Unfortunately, all I had was yellow onions so I sauteed them just under carmelized and added the black beans to the pan with some cumin and a pinch if taco seasoning. This caused some beans to open which gave it a chunky refried bean conistency. (yay!) In a separate pan I quick sauteed corn w/salt & pepper & then mixed them both together. I used a little less cheese then recommended & served with mashed avocado on the side. A great finger food that my kids LOVED and asked for it to become a regular.

I've been making this dish for years with absolutely no substitutions or changes. It's a winner in my family!

Brought these to a friend's house for a new years eve party and they were devoured in 10 minutes! Changes to the recipe: a) Substituted scallions for the red onions as some of the other posts suggested. b) Threw the beans in the blender along with enough water to mix properly, then cooked them with chili powder, garlic and cumin. I did this to help keep the assembled cakes stay together since it would be served as finger food. Next time: a) Put only half of the beans in the blender. This will still help to hold everything together but having some whole beans in there will give it a better texture. b) Add canned or fresh chopped chilis to give it a little more kick.

Very easy, a great appetizer for a crowd. If you like spicy add cayenne to the cheese mixture or add some peppers.

Canned black beans? Are you loco? Nobody in their right mind would let a canned black bean touch their recipe!

Although no vegetarian, I'm trying to incorporate more meatless dishes in my menu. This seemed simple enough (and it was). While assembling the layers, I had my doubts about how this would turn out, but it actually comes out of the oven looking much better than going in, and proved to be tasty enough. Used more cayenne pepper, and I think I would use a can or two of green chilies next time.

So easy and very delicious. A great appetizer to serve. I'm making it a few times this month.

This was very good and quite easy to make, but a little heavy on the cheese and light on the veggies for my taste. Next time I will cut the cheese and add more beans, corn, and add red pepper. I did add some cumin and chili powder, as other reviewers recommended, which gave it a nice kick. I also added some cayenne to the corn and beans mixture as well as sprinkling some on top.

I have made this three times for different people in the last week - so easy and yummy! I add another 1/2 c of beans, add a small can of diced green chilis to the bean/corn/onion mix, and reduce each kind of cheese by about 1/4 c - I like the ratios better this way. Also, instead of oil I use cooking spray on the top tortillas and sprinkle the cayenne on top. Will definitely make this again and again, great for lunch, a light dinner, or as appetizers.

Delicious and simple recipe. I used shallots in place of the red onion. I also used larger tortillas and made only one large tortilla cake.

This was such a hit I have served it to many sets of guests. I mixed a bit of cumin in with the beans corn and onions. I used small cake pans to bake them as it kept all the ingredients more tidy.

This was a great appetizer. So tasty and easy.

I've made these 3 times, all to rave reviews. We prefer green onions instead of the red onion, though. The red onion overpowers the nice flavor of the extra sharp white cheddar. They do burn easily - be careful!

As other reviewers state, these are very popular. I added cumin and a little chili powder. Next time I think I could cut down the cheese in total and maybe mix it half and half with a low fat cheese to cut some of the fat calories. Flavor is so good I think it would carry it.

These were wonderful! I only had the large tortillas (burrito size), so I just made 2 instead of 3. Used 16 oz. shredded mexican cheese blend. Served with sour cream....turned out perfect!!

Great recipe. Just watch the oven when you bake, cause it's very easy to scorch tortillas. Serve with salsa and sour cream to make fabulous meal.

I've made this dish numerous times since it came out in the magazine, always to rave reviews. It's a summer favorite. My only change is to saute the red onions before cooking, otherwise they are too strong. You can also substitute scallions.

I added the cumin and chili powder also, and they just flew off the table. Soo easy and everyone raved about them and asked where I found the recipe !! Be careful not to leave them in too long,or the tops will burn

So easy, yet so good! I used frozen corn which made it extra quick, and added some garlic to corn and bean mixture. A little salsa and sour cream on the side- great appetizer or dinner with a bowl of soup. (I made the tomato, zucchini, and tortilla soup from this site- YUM!)

4 forks with the following changes: add 1 tsp. each of cumin & chili powder and 1/2 tsp. salt. Brush top with oil, 1/8 tsp. cayenne and juice from one lemon to kick it up. Then bake for 5 min more in a 400 oven. It's so easy & soooooo good!

This was so easy and VERY tasty. I made this last night and my husband and I ate it as an entree. I used Pepperjack cheese instead of Monterey Jack. And for dipping, we used sourcream and taco sauce. Absolutely delicious.

We really enjoy this recipe. It's a quick fix (canned corn works in a pinch) and if you don't go overboard on the cheese, it's fairly healthy. I, too, brought it for an appetizer, but unless you add a lot of cheese, they do not hold well together. It's not a great finger food.

This has become one of my stock appetizers. It's so quick and easy and I always have the ingredients on hand (substituting frozen corn in the off-season).

I thought this was excellent - and so easy! Will definitely be making this one again! It's even good leftover!

Everyone I make this for absolutely loves it! Everything tastes so fresh and the prep/cooking time is so easy to work with... I've served it as a main dish and as an appetizer. Try it - if you like all the ingredients in the recipe, especially black beans, you won't be disappointed.

These were a big hit at a recent dinner party. Served as an appetizer (cut each tortilla into 4 wedges)with salsa on the side for extra zing. Could see making them again and adding chorizo or shredded chicken or beef and serve as a main dish. Very easy to prepare

I have made this a few times, sautee-ing the onion with some bell pepper or zucchini. It was very bland an tasteless when I tried it the first time. Also, I put some Oregano and Thyme in the onions while sautee-ing too.

I must have done something wrong with this recipe! I found it to be incredibly bland and tasteless. Unfortunately, my family, who are normally adventurous and forgiving of missing the mark, agreed with me that it was not close enough to try again.

I have been making this dish since it appeared in the 1995 issue. It is fantastic, and always gets rave reviews. I have served it as an appetizer, and as a light dinner with a salad. Depending on how rich you want it, one tortilla layer can be eliminated and it still tastes great.

Another favorite recipe, and one that I like pairing with the "Grilled Spiced Flank Steak".

I have made this on countless occasions now and always get rave reviews. The sweet corn and bean combination not only tastes fabulous but is a healthy pair. Have served it as an appetizer and a side dish.
