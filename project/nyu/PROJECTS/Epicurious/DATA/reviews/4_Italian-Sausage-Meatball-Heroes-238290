I added a 1/2 pound of hamburg and browned the meatballs first, then drained the fat off. Boiled in the marinara sauce after. Great.

I've made these twice now. The first time I stuck exactly to the recipe. I found that the sauce was a bit greasy and the meatballs were a bit tough. I did buy fresh marinara but I didn't think it was that great. Second time through I added a piece of italian bread that had been soaked in cream to the meatball mixture. I baked the meatballs and made marinara with fresh roma tomatoes. A bit more work to make the sauce but it was worth it. I would rate four stars on the 2nd attempt but only three for the recipe exactly as written.

Really excellent, I used hot Italian turkey sausage (baked the meatballs first as some reviewers suggested) and part-skim mozzarella, otherwise followed the recipe. I am not a huge sausage fan but my husband is so I made this for him and I ended up liking it as much as he did, definitely will make again.

Delicious! I swaped turkey sauasge for pork sausage to cut down the fat and you couldn't even tell. I also used Marcella Hazan's recipe for marinara. I'm filing it this in my "good for monday night football" folder...

Made this last night, and it was a hit! I found some delicious caramelized onion rolls at the bakery ... mmm! Even my 4-year-old and 1-year-old enjoyed this one.

This was good but I didn't think it was outstanding. I added mixed cheeses instead of just mozza. I would make it again and spice it up a little more...kick up the sauce.

Good flavor but way too messy and hard to eat to serve at a party.

this was yummy. i made this for my superbowl party. big hit. my kids like to help cook and they loved squishing the sausage meat with the fresh maranara. i made the meatballs and sauce the night before the game. then reheated to a boil. i would recommend cruchy bread else it gets a little too soggy.

I made this recipe when it first came out in the magazine and it was delish! I was about 5 months pregnant with our second son and couldn't get enough tomato sauce, so this did the trick. However, I ended up in the hospital the next day with an awful virus and spent four days there. I know it had nothing to do with this recipe, but I've been afraid to eat it since! Maybe it's a sign, but it's come up twice in my menu planning this week.

I just loved this. A nice spin on a meatball sub. My boyfriend really enjoyed it as well.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I followed the advice of other cooks by adding more marinara sauce and bread crumbs to the meatball mixture. I also baked the meatballs at 400F (200C) for 20 minutes, before placing the meatballs in the marinara sauce to simmer as directed. The recipe turned out fabulous. The meatballs were very tender and juicy. The Heros were delish! This recipe is a keeper!

Husband says this is a keeper! Threw some breadcrumbs and extra marinara in the meatballs as previous reviews suggested. Next time I will try with turkey sausage!

This recipe is awesome! I think the fresh marinara makes a huge difference. I will try adding a slice of bread to the meatballs to make it softer, but I found adding extra marinara works too. The sandwiches are messy, but taste great.

For those who had "tough" meatballs,try adding a slice of bread that was soaked in water or milk. Soak it for a few minutes, then tear it up and add it the sausage.

I made these meatballs just for pasta. I liked the fact that they were not loaded up with bread crumbs. As one reviewer stated, we chose the Newman's Own maranara and it was a VERY good sauce. Wife and kids loved the dinner.

We thought these were just ok. The results were somewhat greasy and the meatballs would have been better if they'd been a little more tender. Definitely fast and easy though, with a good flavor that is likely to please. We used a jar of Newman's Own marinara for a quick easy dinner and didn't find the sauce lacking.

This didn't take too long to make and was good.

This was so good. I made it for the boys while they watched football. The only thing I will do different next time is too add a little more sauce when cooking meatballs. My husband loved it!

Great quick and easy recipe!. I substituted italian turkey sausage... and added a handful of Progresso bread crumbs to the meatball mixture. Used leftover meatballs and sauce later in the week with penne pasta and freshly grated parmesan cheese. Very tasty.... and two meals in one..... We both loved it and will definately make again!

Tasty and easy. I use bottled (not fresh) organic marinara and fresh chicken italian sausages, and it works well this way.

Excellent recipe! I agree that fresh marinara is key. This is a keeper.

Make your own sauce. It only takes another 1/2 hour and will be much better than ANY sauce you can buy.

These were good for what they were - subs! I'll make them again, they were enjoyed. As my husband said, "MMM Much much much nicer than a deli meatball sub". But at the end of the day, it was still a meatball sub!

Wonderful recipe! Delicious and easy to make. I seared the meatballs before adding the sauce and cooking to finish, adds a nice flavor and texture. I picked up fresh marinara at the corner Italian restaurant, and the freshness really does make a difference. I will definitely add this to my standard dinner recipes!

Really good! I used hot italian sausage and it was yummy. I used leftovers over pasta - so versatile too!

I made this for my boyfriend who could not stop talking about it afterwards. Quick and easy to make and very flavorful!!

Very good and very easy. My husband hates eating anything that resembles a sandwich for dinner so I turned it into a pasta dish. I made the meatballs the same as the recipe and at the end I just put them in a foil-rimmed pan and sprinkled cheese on top and put them in the oven. I made bowtie pasta and we put the marinara from the skillet on the pasta and had the meatballs. It was delicious.
