Made this today with some gorgeous red heirlooms from my CSA box. I agree with the other reviewer who said this needed an extra hit of sherry vinegar. Other than that, it's great. The tomato flavor is fresh and exceptional. I didn't peel the tomatoes but just chopped them and the remaining bits of peel were strained out in that step, so it worked great. Would definitely make this again. It's a great no-cook summer meal alongside a baguette and some goat cheese.

Fantastic recipe. I used freshly picked Heirlooms from my garden - such a treat! A great way to use tomatoes if you have alot picked. I added a bit extra sherry vinegar, but otherwise as is was perfect.

This recipe made enough for a very delicious, light lunch for two. I used three perfect small heirloom tomatoes and very fresh baby fennel, and it really brought out the flavor of those ingredients. It was such a beautiful way to celebrate the beginning of tomato season!

This is delicious. Use top quality ingredients and stick to the recipe. It doesn't make much soup, but it's so flavorful that you really don't need much for a serving. The other review is giving it one star after having completely altering the recipe!

This is absolutely delicious. Use top quality ingredients and stick to the recipe and you can't miss. No, it doesn't make a lot of soup, but it's so intense and flavorful that you don't need much per serving. I don't understand how the other reviewer can give it one star, when they're reviewing the dish after they added a bunch of stock and cooked it!

I doubled this recipe in order to have leftovers for the next day, however after straining the puree I only ended up with 1/2 cup of soup. Ended up using puree and added about 2 cups of chicken broth to obtain 3 bowls of soup. Added the listed garnishments & heated on the stove. Sprinkled grated asiago on top of each bowl. It ended up tasting quite good, but not the best tomato soup I've had.
