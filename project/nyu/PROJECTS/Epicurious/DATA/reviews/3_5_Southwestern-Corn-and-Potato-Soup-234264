I love this soup and so does my husband. It's extremely quick to prepare and the avocado is an excellent final touch! I even used bottled jalapeños and it was yummy. BIg thumbs up!

This soup was disappointing. I always make a recipe exactly as written the first time. We found this soup kinda bland even with the jalapeno. I will probably not bother with this recipe again.

This soup was pretty fantastic -- I didn't have a jalepeño around so I made due with cayenne pepper. I also added some garlic and threw in some shredded bacon along with the cilantro and lime juice. Awesome!

Delicious & cheap! We topped our soup with a dallop of light sour cream. Yum! We'll def keep this recipe. -Little Tip: Trader J's has super cheap & delicious FREE RANGE chicken broth :D

Good for a winter evening as the jalapeno heats things up. Super easy. When reheating I added a little bit of milk as it thickened overnight in the fridge.

This was good, but a little too spicy for my liking; however, I will admit I did not seed the jalapeno because I do like spicy food, but not with this potato soup.

I made this exactly as the recipe described. I do that to rate it on its own merit. I thought this was just ok. It needed something to excite the taste buds. The texture was good and the soup was hardy enough. I was disappointed there wasn't more of a bite from the Jalapeño but I don't think that is all that was missing. I may try a chipotle or 2 to give it a smoky flavor.

Delicious as is, easy to play around with. I usually add black beans & a few more pepper varieties. Sometimes add grilled chicken.

This soup was so easy to make and it freezes well. I usually do not like the taste of most canned soup because they taste really fake and isn't hearty for a cold winter night, so i usually make a big batch of soup I can freeze. This one didn't get over cooked even after defrosting it in the microwave. It can be a little spicy for those who do not like the taste of spicy. You could forgo the jalapeno, but I kept it in. The heat builds up as you keep eating it.

I have made this 5 different times for 5 different audiences and it has always impressed.

I say 2.5 stars. I did make a few substitutions. I only had russets on hand and I used a can of green chiles as I didn't have a jalepeno. I thought it was good but not as a main dish. I also added a dash of cumin because I heart cumin. I think the addition of rotisserie chicken would be good next time.

This was great! Like others, I made some modifications... sauteed some celery and shallots with the jalepeno, added shredded BBQ chicken (leftovers), flavoured with cumin and chili powder, added a bit more potato for some heartiness, and some salsa. Everything else I followed and I always make my soup earlier and let it cool down and thicken before heating it back up. Delish! And even better the next day!

Followed the basic recipe omitting the jalapeno. Added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 tsp. cumin, 1/2 tsp. oregano, sprinkle of chili powder, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1 cup extra chunky salsa and topped it off with grated sharp cheddar cheese. Can't wait to have it again!!!!!

Fantastic as a cream soup base, not so much on its own.Don't get me wrong, the original is good, but there's something missing and it feels a bit bland. I would say cumin and tomato make good additions. Chicken if you're not going for a meatless meal.

This turned out really good, thanks everyone for your suggestions below! We did add some honey to it and blended about 2/3rds of it after the corn was added. This tasted great with some lime infused tortilla chips and avocado as well. This did need a little more spice though...

Rating: 4
This is a pretty delicious recipe. I found that by blending about 50% of the soup, it really spread the wonderful corn flavor to every bite of the soup and improved it significantly.

Rating: 3
Very tasty, but made some substitutions: 16 oz. can of diced tomatoes, dash of cumin, and a drizzle of honey to bring out the sweetness of the corn a bit more. Without those changes, I thought it was a little bland.

I just cooked this tonight and we loved it. I made a few changes for the children I was feeding it to! I omitted the jalapeno and added some ground coriander and oregano, I used russet potatoes and didn't mash them up, and I roasted some grape tomatoes under the broiler until they were slightly blackened and added some to the bottom of everyone's bowl before ladling the soup over them! Garnished with avocado, cilantro and black corn tortilla chips. It was delicious and I will definitely make it again!

disappointing - not much zest or flavor

I made this soup according to the recipe, with the only change being the use of fresh corn instead of frozen. The texture is good, but I found it lacking in flavor. It would make a good base for adding other ingredients to liven it up, but on its own it could use some improvement.

Delicious! I added a tbsp. of tomato paste and shredded chicken as others suggested and it was amazing. I would highly recommend these additions as it adds thickness and great texture with the chicken. My husband and I loved it and will definitely make again.

I loved the texture of this soup, but in my opinion it could use slightly more flavor. The lime and cilantro give it a great fresh flavor, it needs just a little something more. I think it could benefit from a garlic clove being cooked with the onions, which is what I am planning on trying next time.

My husband said he could eat this soup for a week. When we made it, we had no cilantro or avocado. We did, however, add pre-roasted chicken bringing the soup back to simmer before adding corn and lime. I am looking forward to trying this again with cilantro and avocado.

My wife REQUIRES me to make this at least once a month. I typically add some serrano peppers mid stage and add the meat of a (grocery store) pre-roasted chicken bringing back to simmer before adding the corn/lime/cilantro. Good stuff.

This soup is a delight! I made it just as the recipe specified. Easy to make and freezes well, which is important to me since no matter how good a soup is, I don't want to eat if every day for a week!

This was very good and and it was a hit with me and my partner. I used russet potatos instead and gently cooked them until the potatos just started to fall apart to thicken the stew. I also Added 1 tbl spoon of tomato puree, shredded chicken breast and 1 diced carrot for extra color.

We just ate this soup for dinner. The only change that we made was using fresh corn instead of frozen. Short review: It was good. Long Review: The lime and cilantro are the main flavor components of this soup. The crunch of the corn with the softness of the potatoes was a good contrast. It tasted light, fresh, and subtley flavorful. We served it with chopped avocados which added a nice creaminess and rounded out the flavor by balancing the lime. I think it might be interesting garnished with some toasted cumin seeds.

I just finished a bowl of this soup and I'm quite pleased. I followed the recipe and added a garnish of fresh diced tomatoes for flavor and color when served. The lime juice is essential.

Very Tasty and reasonably healthy, my husband is an unhealthy chowder loving sort but this totally fooled him, he said, I should make this a staple!

After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this soup. Unfortunately none of those hopes were fulfilled. The soup seemed to be bland (even after additional salting) and felt like a waste of good Yukon Golds. Fresh homemade tortilla chips, avocado, the works and still tasteless. Definitely will not be making this again.

Thought that this soup was great, really quick and delicious! I used sweet potatoes because I prefer them to "regular" ones. Next time I'll probably add some sort of meat most likely chicken knowing me.

Very good, and very easy. I stirred in about 1/2 cup of chopped raw shrimp right as I removed the soup from the heat. They worked really well texturally, and went nicely with the lime juice.

I absolutely love this soup. I made it with russett potatoes and added some ripe roma tomatoes which just added to the wonderful flavors. Mother and friends loved it too.

It was wonderful. My partner and I devoured the whole thing. One addtion: I poached a chicken breast and added the shredded pieces. Unless you're going veggie, I thought the soup needed something else. Will keep in the rep.

i followed the directions exactly and it came out amazing. my guests and boyfriend loved it! the lime and avocado lighten up the dish and make it perfect for even a summertime meal.

Fabulous and so easy. Made with 1-2 extra potatoes so when mashed, soup had more texture. Served with baked pita chips instead of tortilla chips. Lime and avocado are a must!

Rating: 3
I skipped the limes and used russet instead of yukon gold potatoes. I thought the soup was fantastic (although not too summery). Will perhaps put corn tortilla strips in the soup next time (like tortilla soup) since I don't eat chicken. The only reason I'm giving it 3 forks instead of 4 is that my husband thought is was a tad bland.

My husband and I loved this soup. He riced the potatoes instead of mashing them, which gave it a nice texture. The fresh avocadoes are a great accompaniment, as are chips and salsa.

A good soup that was quick to throw together. I made the recipe as stated but added some cooked, shredded pork. I would leave the potatoes in chunks next time. Mashing them didn't seem to do much for thickness.
