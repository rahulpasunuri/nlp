I've made this many times. I learned to make it in a cooking with spices class in Seattle. However, I like more flavor so I used much more spice blend. To those say it doesn't have enough flavor I suggest using what the entire spice blend yields (a little over 4 tablespoons) rather than just one tablespoon. It's a wonderful fall/winter soup for a cold rainy day which we have many in Seattle. It's one of my favorites!!!

I would give 5 stars. Everytime it is a success.

This is a strange recipe. It says to saute the vegetables until tender, and then to boil them until tender. If they're already tender, why do they need to be boiled for another 40 minutes? Also, good luck determining when the onions are translucent when cooked with the spices and vegetables. I wish the recipe writers would include weights when calling for a "medium" onion or "large" carrots. There's a lot of variation. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, so I can't complain about it not being fantastic. That said, it has a flavor unlike any other soup I've made, and it's a flavor I liked. I will probably make some variation of the soup again. Suggestion: prepare 1/4 of the spice blend and then make the soup on top of it.

I thought this soup was fantastic. Rich,deep flavours. Would go well with Indian food. A keeper.

I made this for a Traditional Friday night dinner I was making for some friends and all of us but one person were totally dissappointed with it! IT was a lot of work for nothing and the taste was bitter- strange- and even though we are all very expermental with our food- nobody finished their bowl- which was their polite way of saying IT SUCKED!

I thought that this was just OK. I will admit that my kids enjoyed the soup more than I did. Although I don't have anything bad to say about this soup, I do think that there are other carrot soups that I enjoy more.

This soup was delicious and easy to make! I would definitely make it again. Next time I might try using cilantro rather than parsley. I also used fat free chicken broth and did not feel that it compromised at all on the taste.

Would you believe me if I said this was the best soup I've ever had! The flavors blend in perfect harmony. It is a relatively simple soup process and the results are beyond comparison.
