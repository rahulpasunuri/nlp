Served it to first time guests. Yhr rub has a very different flavor. We all liked it, but I can see where it may not appeal to everyone.

this is wonderful - most significantly with the sweet potato salad* - on my first attempt of this i accidentally picked up the cayenne pepper instead of the paprika - man it was spicy but SOOOOOO good - i now add about 1/2 - 3/4 tsp of cayenne to the original rub and think it out of this world - huge hit at parties and very easy since most everything can be done ahead of time. *a quick cheat is to mix the sweet potato and arugula (dressings and all) together and just place the steak atop - less steps, just as delicious and a nice presentation)

I used this rub on some filet mignon steaks. I had a beef tenderloin that I cut into steaks. Fabulous flavor. Would not say this had tenderizing potential, but really tasty.

I didn't have time to marinate over night so I added the worchestshire sauce as recommended and only marinated at room temp for about 4 hours - super flavorfull and delicious. I was also curious about Skirt steak vs. Flank so did one of each. I preferred the skirt steak but my husband preferred the flank!

I made this recipe as stated and added about 2 tablespoons of worcheshire sauce based upon a previous review. It marinated for three hours and it was the best meat I've ever made. Honestly so easy and absolutely fabulous!!

A slightly different recipe from _Gourmet Today_ cookbook called for marinating at room temperature for 30 minutes. I tried it, and the results were very tasty. The biggest difference between this recipe and the one that I used was 2 teaspoons of Worchestershire sauce. Maybe adding Worchestershire to this recipe would facilitate a shorter marinade. I think it is worth a try. I did not rate this recipe because I used a different recipe. I submitted this review because I wanted to let people know that a shorter marinade produced an excellent meal. By the way, the recipe that I used is on this site (Grilled Spicy Skirt Steak, (Gourmet_ 1994). It has very good reviews.

I agree with all the other raves. I substituted flank steak. Very delicious. Consider this enough for 6 with small appetites though. We doubled the recipe and served 12 but only 2 bites were leftover and 4 of the 12 were children under the age of 12! Would have loved leftovers to make fajitas....

sanny is right on -- the meat does a terrific job of absorbing flavor, unlike flank steak which I've had less success with of late, tho not sure why. I have to laugh, tho, when people refer to this as a cheap cut of meat. $14.99 a pound at Wegman's. This ceased being a cheap cut of meat the day fajitas became mainstream.

We made this per the recipe (adjusted cooking time for our preferences-more rare). It was very good especially with the sweet potato salad that is recommended.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe many times and love, love, love it! First time out I made it exactly as directed, but found it a little too salty. I now double the spices and halve the salt. I serve it like fajitas but the steak definitely can stand on it's own.

This is super yummy! It is packed with flavor & turns out tender. The suggested side of sweet potato salad is a must.

Rating: 4
Absolutely amazing and easy. Must use skirt steak since if is a very tender cut and porous and absorbs the rub easily. Would be great in tacos as well.

Wonderful combination of spices! I served it with the Grilled Herb Potatoes last night and I will repeat both.

I made this for my boyfriend last night and followed the recipe to the tee! Something I rarely do. The steak cooked perfectly according to the grill directions. However, the flank steak was a little tough because of a streak of fat or tendon running through it. That distracted from him enjoying the meal. I paired it with the sweet potato salad and watercress, as recommended, which were quite good. The plate was beautiful!

This was great. Skirt steak is so flavorful, dont know why I dont eat it more. I made more of the rub/marinade, but I still could have done with a little more flavor. I think i will let it marinate longer, I did it right at 6 hrs. It was great with a roasted sweet potato salad (not the recommended one) and the arugula lemon salad. flavors meshed perfectly. Great for a summer grillout night!

I really think the cook from Atlanta needs to give skirt steak another chance. If you don't cut skirt steak properly, yup, it's like rubber bands! But if you do, it is tender and delicious. The recipe says: "Cut steak diagonally across grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices." Hoping this cook will try again and report back to us.

Instead of the listed spices, I used some Ras el Hanout because it contained many of the same spices. The steak was delicious. I am reserving four stars for after I taste it using exactly the spices called for, although I don't know how it could get much better. Skirt steak is my favorite. I don't know why it isn't more popular.

Skirt steak doesn't get enough credit -- cheap and flavorful, it far exceeds tips or even filet Mignon.

This is soooooo delicious! ;) You just can't go wrong with this tasty rub! I like to serve it with~ Arugula and Peach Salad with Creamy Chive Vinaigrette....yum-o! :)

Great recipe. I would definitely make extra of the rub/marinade. My 8 year old gave it two thumbs up! I made it with the sweet potato salad and I roasted the potatoes instead of boiling them. We prefer the flavor of roasting with olive oil, salt & garlic.

On Saturday at around 2:00pm, I put all the ingredients together and rubbed them on the skirt steak with the expectation that I would cook them on the grill at about 6:00pm. Then at around 4:00pm, my wife asked me to go to see Sarah Palin, Candidate for Vice President, who was speaking at the Raleigh Exposition Center. So I left the steaks in the refrigerator. Since we did not return until much later in the evening, I did not get around to cooking them at all on Saturday. On Sunday at about 6:30pm, I realized that I was completely out of propane. Rather than make a last-minute run to the grocery store for another tank, I cooked the steaks on a cast-iron skillet instead. The results were incredible. I cant wait to make this dish again.

I've made this many times. Never fails to please me and everyone else. It's got zing, and as long as you start the marinade early enough, it takes two seconds.

Very easy and absolutely delicious. We have used this for many summer parties and always get rave reviews from all our guests.

My family thought this was good, but I did not care much for the blend of spices in the rub. It just didn't compare with some of the other recipes I have made from this website. Since I am the cook, I probably would not make again.

to the one that didnt like this recipe.. a. you cooked it to long b. this steak must be cut against the grain in 1/4 to 1/2 in skices at a angle ... if no it wlll be the toughest meat on the planet...key step . I love this cut of meat , had it last night ... wrap this in a corn tortilla and and guaumole dip, choped onions and some cilantro ....

Yum! I decided to buy a more expensive and better quality cut of beef, and it turned out beautifully with a quite unique flavor combination in the spice rub.

Rating: 0
Clearly, I am in the minority, but this was not a good recipe for me. I am not used to this cut of meat and it turned out the texture of rubber bands. We all took a bite and cracked up--it was ridiculous. I can't even comment on the flavor because the texture was terrible. Not only will I not make the recipe again, I'll avoid this cut of meat.

I found that there wasn't enough marinade for the steak. Maybe Ill add more spices next time or try making a sauce for it first and rub the spice on just before cooking. Otherwise this was good. Never tried skirt steak and I'm glad I did.

I've made the steak twice already and both times it was great! I love it so much that I even tried it on stew beef and turkey and baked it in the oven. It came out really good! My family loves it!

My husband and I both loved this! I had never cooked skirt steak before and found it to be very tender and flavorful. I grilled it outdoors, which probably enhanced the flavor. I served it with the sweet potato salad and arugula, which were also quite good.

Excellent flavorful dish! I served with the Sweet Potato Salad with Chili-Lime dressing and the lemon and olive oil salad (to which I added a little garlic, honey, almonds and blueberries.) Out of this world combination...and so easy.

I made this with flank steak as I couldn't find a skirt but it was FABULOUS especially served room temp with the side dishes that were featured in the magazine -the sweet potatoe salad and arugula brought all the flavors to life. It really is divine.

Great recipe. I used Flank steak. Marinated it 24 hours. The accompanying dishes worked very well with this, however, I used Spring Mix instead of Arugula. Was great.

I made this entire recipe (including the salads) and it was an enormous hit - even the first time. I've made it several times for summer dinner parties, and it's absolutely perfect. This will definitely become one part of my repertoire. Thank you!

I followed this recipe exactly. It was delicious. I used a grilling pan over my stove top and it was perfect too.(Even my 5yr old loved it.) In the future I would use a little less salt. We did find it a bit salty. I can't wait to make this dish again over the grill for a bar-b que.

I use flank steak when I can't find skirt steak, and this easy dish always comes out delicious. I've left the rub on it for up to 3 days before cooking, and it comes out fine.

This is a great recipe. Skirt steak is the best type of beef for grilling. Comes out juicy and flavorful every time.

This is a great gourmet twist on the classic summer meal of steak, potato salad and salad. Prepared exactly as recipe says, using "flank" steak. I made it for my husband and me one night, with a nice presentation on the plate, and we thought it was great. Next time I made it for 14 people and they all loved it. I cooked the steaks on a HOT HOT charcoal fire ... 2 minutes per side ... for rare. Perfect. (For the 14 people, I bought flank steaks at Costco, and they were fine, even after freezing and thawing; saved a bunch of money, too.)

Definitely would make this again. I cut it in half and I thought there would not be enough spice mixture for the skirt steak, but there was just enough to spread a thin layer and I did marinate it for 6 hours. Delightful with the sweet-potato salad and arugula. Great Flavors!!

Rating: 3
I've already made this recipe several times. I think I am hooked! This was my first time using skirt steak, and its worth tracking down. The meat has great flavor and its much more tender then flank steak. Its worth a special order to try it. Luckly my market carries it regularily.

PLEASE NOTE!! ERROR ON PREVIOUS REVIEW!!! This recipe was wonderful. My husband added 2 Teaspoons of Curry powder and the flavor was typically more Indian. Worked well. Had amazing reviews from the guests and leftovers were terrific! If you ever wanted to re-create that Indian restaurant flavor this is it!

We tried this recipe with skirt steak and really enjoyed it. As we live in an area where skirt steak is not readily available, our butcher suggested sirloin. For this dinner we used the rub on chicken (marinated for 4 hours only), and served chicken and sirloin with the sweet potato salad and arugula salad. This combination is a keeper!

I'm not sure what the cook from California did wrong, but I thought this was wonderful. I read Gourmet every month and I've already made this entire recipe (including the potatoes and arugula) three times. It's quick, easy, and delicious. My favorite combination. Three cheers.

I made this along with the Arugula w/ Lemon & Olive Oil and the Dijon-Vinagrette Sweet Potatoes. I thought it was an excellent combination. The prep work was fairly simple, and the results were very flavorful. It was well received by everyone. The next time I make it, I think I might reduce slightly the amount of cinnamon as that tended to overwhelm some of the other flavors in the dish.

I broiled rather than grilled the steak. Found it quite good - the corriander and cumin gave it a middle-eastern flavor. My husband loved it and has requested that it be made again
