I agreed with other reviews that it was bland. I doubled hots, and used pine nuts (which was the part I liked best). I dumped a ton of parm in when it didn't taste like anything and that worked. My family liked it a lot.

This recipe is packed full of flavor, and you can adjust the heat to your preference. I've made it a couple times and look forward to it again. Linguine can easily be substituted for another more fork friendly pasta shape.

I found a cilantro pesto at the Concord California Farmers Market. Vendor's website is www.BolaniAndSauce.com

I won't rate this, as I made a few changes. For taste preferences I skipped the pecans, jalapeno and cilantro and it still turned out really well. Can be made very quickly and is quite easy to make.

A great meal that isn't too much work. Would be great for dinner guests. Next time I will add sun dried tomatoes to the garlic/onion/pecan mix and maybe top with capers. Great little recipe!

I used whole wheat parpadalle noodles, and the nutty flavor really enhanced this dish! This is definitely going into heavy rotation in my repertoire: very easy and delicious!

This was OK, but I didn't think it lived up to the reviews. Definitely need to add more jalapeno and crushed red pepper - very little came through the pesto. In fact, the pesto pretty much overwhelmed everything else in the dish. It's not a bad recipe, but you could just brown some chicken and toss it with pesto & pasta and have about the same thing with less effort.

Nice, easy for middle of the week dinner. Used white onion instead and also used entire large jalapeño pepper and 2x the crushed red pepper as many suggested. Also, to add more bulk to the sauce, I threw in a chopped tomato while sautéing the veggies. Served on whole wheat pasta. YUM!

We've been making this recipe for over 10 years, since my husband found it in Bon Appetit. It is fast and delicious. The heat will depend on what type of chili you add, and how much. It's great for entertaining or a family meal.

very tasty! used more pesto and pecans as suggested. Also used chicken broth to loosen sauce after linguine added (instead of pasta water)... delicious and easy.

Easy, great flavors! Used extra jalapenos. Would be good without chicken for those preferring vegetarian.

I used homemade pesto, dried minced garlic...couldn't beleive I was out of fresh, and I had no cilantro, so I used parsley. It was really good. Other reviews said it wasnt spicy enough, so I stuck to the recipes measurements, I'm feeding a 2 1/2 year old, so I figured it would be just right. He noticed the spice, but still liked it... washed down with plenty of milk! I can't wait to try it again with the cilantro.

After reading reviews I knew I would want to kick up the spice on to suit my taste. I used two scoth bonnet peppers and doubled the red pepper flakes. I also followed other suggestions and used a bit more pesto. It was terrific! Quick, easy, and big on flavor. The extra spice aded some pop but didn't over power the other flavors.The pecans added a really nice texture and flavor. Like others, I thought the pesto and cilantro were an odd combo but worth a try. Glad I did, I feel like I'm in a little flavor secret. ;)

Very light and refreshing but needs a few tweaks. I added an entire jalenpeno with seeds along with more cilantro and pecans as other reviewers suggested. I also added a green and red pepper as well as a chopped dried red chile and it still was not spicy. I'll add more spice again next time so it has real kick. Worth a try!

On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this an 8.5 I agree with others who said that the dish was not spicy. I would also use more pesto because it was more like a pesto coating on the chicken, not really a sacue. But overall it worked for us and will defintely make this again.

Not enough sauce for 12 ounces of pasta, so we used just about half of the pasta called for. I really liked the cilantro/pecan mixture, but it got a little lost in the pesto flavor. Next time, I'll put more green onions/cilantro/pecans/garlic/jalepenos.

Very good. The ingredients really work together. The only thing is that it wasn't really spicy. Next time I will add more jalapeno or red pepper.

I tried this recipe as a way to use up an abundance of basil and I found it to be an easy to prepare dish with a very unusual but esp. tasty combination of herbs. I've prepared it many times over the past several years and have always received rave reviews from friends & family.

What fun! I had some homeade pesto onhand that needed to be used, and I happened upon this recipe. Who knew that cilantro, pesto, and cilantro actually complimented each other?! This recipe has a wonderful complexity that could be used as a starter course, or main course in either casual or formal settings. This will be a staple in our weekly repertoire for years to come.

This one'll go in my recipe box for sure with the following comments: add more chicken in wider strips; omit the jalapenos; don't burn the pecans.

I've made this several times now and it's turned out great every time. Definitely agree with the others who say to keep the nuts - they really make the dish. I've made this with both rice and regular wheat noodles and both ways works well.

Yum yum! Made this with what I had on hand: substituted boneless chicken thighs for breasts, Italian parsley for cilantro, and double red pepper flakes for the jalapeno. I also made my own pesto because I had lots of basil, but wouldn't hesitate to use store-bought. Made the whole recipe but cut down on the linguine, and it served my husband and me generously with scant left-overs. This will become a staple - good enough for company, but easily made on a week night. And don't omit the pecans - I thought they added a lot to the dish.

Very nice balence of flavors. Refreshingly different.

Quick enough for weeknights and yet, impressive enough for company. Who would have thought - cilantro and pesto? I used walnuts which I toasted first and I wouldn't dream of making this dish without nuts - they are so good. I didn't have a jalapeno so just relied on red pepper flakes for heat and it worked great. Save a lot of pasta water - it's amazing how much it takes to loosen it up. Sometimes I find myself turning into one of those foodies who thinks you have to make everything from scratch blah blah blah - this recipe saved me from food snobbery - put egos aside for this one and just buy the pesto! :)

Very nice. I'm not sure why so many people omitted the nuts, as I found that they worked very well. I used a bit more of the reserved liquid & used homemade pesto as well. Goes well with whole-wheat pasta.

I've been making this dish since I first read it in the July 96 issue. This dish also works well with penne pasta and eaten as a cold pasta salad.

Loved this dish. Very quick & easy to prepare. I left out the nuts. Was surprised that the cilantro & pesto combined so well. It was very spicy and very tasty--I may have used more jalapeno than the recipe calls for. Great weekday meal; great way to use up leftover pesto.

This was wonderful. I cooked it for my boyfriend last night and he took the rest of it with him for lunch the next day. I agree with the other reviews that it needs a little bit more of a kick. I added a whole minced jalapeno and a little more crused red pepper. Also, didn't add the nuts. Yum!

I was a little scared of the flavor combination, but my boyfriend and I thought it turned out very well. I agree it could be a spicier, so next time I will try more pepper. Also left out the nuts.

Just happened to make this because I had all the ingredients (except pecans). Used almonds and extra toasted pine nuts. I also added a few more red pepper flakes at final "taste". Scrumtious, easy, elegant. Now keep everything on hand for quick dinner with a "We deserve it" flavor!

Very easy to make! I was skeptical about the cilantro with pesto, but it gave it a nice freshness.

A definite addition to my easy dinner staples! Skipped out on the pecans and used fettucine (instead of linguine) and homemade pesto (highly recommended!).

I have made this dish again and again for friends and family and the all LOVE it. I admit, it looks a little gross when it is being made, but it is outstanding. It even tastes good as leftovers.

Made this recipe several times and love it. Major change: Added a pint of half-and-half at the same time as adding the pesto. Minor changes: Used bowtie pasta instead of linguini and used 1/2 cup nuts instead of 1/3 cup. Using homemade pesto vs. jar makes a big difference. It's not as spicy as the recipe states so if you want more heat - add more red pepper flakes and seeds from the Jalapeno.

I can see why some people wouldn't like this. My husband and I love it. Easy, goes great with a nice sauvignon blanc. If you like cilantro, you'll love this recipe.

This was a good recipe, but it was far from "spicy". Next time, I will double the crushed pepper and triple the jalapenos. Quick and easy to make.

O.K. I admit it I really didn't make this recipe, but it was a great starting off point. I arrived home tonight and realized I had two chicken breasts, two italian hot sauages and fresh musrooms in the fridge that I had to cook. I did a search and voila, the rest is culinary history. I did not have cilantro or jalapeno. Just doubled the red pepper flakes. I used white wine to deglaze the pan. Ummmm good!

Delicious! My husband loved it. The jalapeno gave it just the right kick without overpowering the other flavors. I used homemade pesto and would definitely make this recipe again.
