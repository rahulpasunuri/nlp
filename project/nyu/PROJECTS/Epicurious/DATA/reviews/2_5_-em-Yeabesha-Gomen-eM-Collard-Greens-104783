I need another recipe for greens, I grown organic collards year around in S.C. We eat them a lot & need a change from the 3 recipes I have now. I agree with other poster, not to pre-boil, but to simmer in pan with onions. I grow my on onions & garlic too.

This is a good, hearty collard recipe. As with many Ethiopian recipes, I found that this lacked a certain kick. A touch of acid--like a vinegar or white wine--and some hot chili would put a lot of life into it.

I always cook my greens like this with one modification: I don't boil the greens first. Why would anyone? After washing your greens, simply saute the onion, garlic, and ginger, add greens and stir until wilted. Add water and simmer until tender. The flavor cooks in this way. I put a couple of whole chiles on top, unbroken. My southern parents always had a bottle of chile-infused white vinegar to season greens at the table. A few drops are a nice complement. This works with any hearty leafy green-- turnips, mustards, kale. Turnip greens are especially good with a chopped whole turnip or two added to the pot. Best enjoyed with a piece of cornbread to sop up the juice.

I recommend a splash of lemon juice to pull this together!

It took too long to make for such little output. Tasted alright, but not great, a bit greasy.

I made this as a side dish for a dinner party I had for some friends. I got raves on the collards! They were so delicious. I don't have any tradition eating collards - so for me these were awesome. I am making them again tonight!

I work at an ethiopian restaurant owned of course, by an Ethiopian family. Their Gomen is mada of collard greens or spinach, spices onions and potatoes. We're in Nova Scotia so we use collards when available, but that's not that often. Their spices are imported directly from Ethiopia so I can't say exactly what they are because they only know the Ethiopian words for them. I think I'll trust their version.

As an African American, I think I will stick to my grandmother's way of cooking collard greens. I think by following the directions, the true flavoring of the onions, garlic, etc.. was not able to cook into the greens. The flavors seemed to stay separate.

These are not my mother's collards. No problem, since I became a vegetarian and gave up the ham hocks years ago. I recommend shortening the initial cooking time by about 5 minutes because of the second simmer. This will accompany my hoppin' john on all future new year's days.
