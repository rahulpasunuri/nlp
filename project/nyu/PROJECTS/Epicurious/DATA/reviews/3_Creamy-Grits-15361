As a third generation Atlanta, a real rarity for the capitol of the South, the creamy grits were a hit. Delicious and different, this recipe is a wonderful variation to try.

The first time I had grits made with cream was at the Windsor Hotel in Americus, GA. Everyone who tasted them commented and wished they knew how to make them. This recipe comes as close as it gets. My family and friends now ask when I'm going to make grits again.

Is this a joke? "Creamy grits" out of stock? This recipe is not worth the time or waste of good ingredients that could be used in another recipe.

As a native of Carleston S.C. and a food professional it pains me to see anyone make grits with cream, milk, etc. Good God, Man! Next thing you know you'll be putting sugar in cornbread!
