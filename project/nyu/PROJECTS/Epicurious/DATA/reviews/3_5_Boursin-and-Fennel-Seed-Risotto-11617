Easy and yummy. The fennel flavor is not strong. We made it per instructions and wouldn't change anything. This is definitely a side dish, and probably rich enough to stand up to red meat (we had it with chicken sausages and sliced tomato, but I'd try it with steak next time!)

I found it edible, my husband hated it. I guess neither of us likes fennel, and I don't like boursin cheese in risotto. The recipe also doesn't tell you how long to cook it, and my risotto turned out more "al dente" than I liked.

Made this for Christmas dinner with our new automatic stirrer which was fantastic! We didn't have to babysit this as much as usual except to add the broth. I added some sauteed squash and zucchini at the end of the dish since we are used to texture in our risotto. I thought the boursin was a nice addition, but I did have to add some parm reg (how could you not?) as well. All in all, a nice easy risotto dish that I would make again.

Everyone has been right about it being easy to make. I was thrilled with this risotto as a side dish. It is extremely rich so I wouldn't suggest it as an entree. It was just right with baked chicken and roasted tomatoes.

Easy and delicious -- completely hits the spot on a chilly winter afternoon. I haven't made risotto before either, but the constant stirring wasn't as tedious or as long as I had anticipated -- and the texture was just right. The whole prep/cooking time took no more than dish 15 minutes total.

Easy to make and very tasty. A nice twist on risotto. I used arborio rice and it turned out great. Note: this 2 servings means 2 side servings - do not plan on it serving 2 people for a main course!

My first attempt at risotto.WOW...it was very good and not as difficult as I have heard risotto is to make. I will definatly make this again- the boursin and fennle was wonderful together!
