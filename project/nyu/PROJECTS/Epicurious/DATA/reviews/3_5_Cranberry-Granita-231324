Too much corn syrup! Granita is supposed to be grainy, but this had a GOOEY texture, like an old popsicle. It's tasty enough to give it another try, but next time I'll use half the corn syrup and fill in the sweetness with stevia.

This was a delight for my Christmas Day dinner guests. Some preferred to not eat the cranberry garnish, but I found them very tasty. The red color adds a lot to a holiday table. It's easy to make and can be stored frozen for weeks.

Not too sweet, not too sour. A perfect palate cleanser. This is my new favorite frozen dessert.

I used this as a palate cleanser before dessert at Christmas. At first I thought it might be a little too sweet but it proved to be a nice balance between all the sugar and the tartness of the berries. I used frozen berries and I can't imagine that using fresh would make much difference. However, make sure you allow more than enough time for the granita to "set" (mine took close to 7 hours), so preparing this the day before is probably a good idea.
