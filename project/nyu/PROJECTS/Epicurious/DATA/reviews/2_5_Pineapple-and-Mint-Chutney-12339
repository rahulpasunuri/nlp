This is the perfect accompaniment to ham or pork chops. The red onion gives it just the right amount of heat while the pineapple compliments with its cool taste. Served with the Christmas ham, everyone loved it. If the pineapple is sweet enough, skip the sugar, I did and no one missed it. Super-yum.
