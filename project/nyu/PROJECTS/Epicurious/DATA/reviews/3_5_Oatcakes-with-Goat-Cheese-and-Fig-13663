The oatcakes were a great hit with my guest, as well as the figs. Everyone wanted the recipe for the oatcakes. I split the dough into two pieces and roll them out between two sheets of was paper. By doing that no flour was used for rolling the dough.

The macerated figs are divine. The oat cakes were very good but fragile. Very elegant for a special party. If you don't want to take the extra time to make the oat cakes, an unsalted, bland cracker such as a water cracker would be a good match.

Based on the other reviews, I made this for a work holiday party. I used a star cookie cutter, and they looked very nice. However, they were not the kind of thing that people went back for seconds and thirds on (unlike the spinach dip, for instance). The goat cheese and figs were a little too much for a casual party.

I made this as a trial for the family, so did not cut the oatcake dough into neat little circles. Instead, I halved the recipe, rolled it into a rectangle and cut it into strips. Highly recommend this method if you don't need to impress anyone! Flavors were very good.

Made for a new year's eve cocktail party. Good makeahead--crackers and figs both kept well. Very easy to do, makes a large quantity, and looks attractive on plate.

This was great. I didn't serve it with goats' cheese, though, I served it as a dessert with gorgonzola. I made the syrup with some fennel seeds added, and put in some toasted almonds to soak while it was cooking. Arrange a wedge of gorgonzola with the figs and almonds in syrup, and oatcakes and served with a glass of good port, it is the most sublime end to a meal anyone could wish for.

I didn't think I would like this as I thought I hated figs, but I decided to make it for a party because the recipe sounded good. I was very impressed by ther results, and ate quite a few myself. It's very easy to make - most of the time is spent assembling them. I added a little bit more milk to the oat cakes so they were easier to handle.

This is a fabulous hors d'oeuvre--particularly good with Lillet or any aperitif. I added a little bit of aged balsamic vinegar to the fig mixture as it simmered, which deepened the flavor wonderfully. A great contrast in colors and textures, plus easy to make.

I only made the oatcakes portion of this recipe and they're wonderful; not too full of fats and there's no sugar. They're great as a healthy snack, since they're mostly oats. I top them w/ a tiny bit of jam or honey.
