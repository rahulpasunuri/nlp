It is fantastic.I've made this torte at least 10 times for Christmas - I first made it in 1996 and still have the magazine recipe which is now covered with sticky memories. My family begs me to make it every year. A word on ingredients: Newman's Own Chocolate Cookies OR Oreo cookie crumbs are both delicious as traditional chocolate wafers are hard to find. Be sure the peppermint candy tastes minty and not artificial. Brachs is a good brand of candy. I double the peppermint extract and use real heavy cream not the ultra pasteurized stuff.

"Delicious." So says my husband. My guests seemed to like it as well. Regarding the oreo cookie crust option noted by several reviewers: 30 oreos to 8 Tbsp/1 stick of butter is plenty. The crust should be a little crumbly. If it's too wet, it becomes a brick when frozen. Here ends my expertise. I knew nothing about how the filling should look or work, so I wish someone had written that the second addition of candy crumbs would not entirely melt. I kept hoping they would.

Fantastic! Very simple to make if you have the time, and a crowd-pleaser for everyone! I didn't bring the crust all the way to the top of the pan, that way a little of the pink peppermint filling peeked in between the ganache sauce topping and the crust, making it even more elegant!

This is the second time I made this. It is so festive for the holiday and looks really hard to make, but it is not. It is a rich desert so a little will go a long way. It is delicious and everyone will love it. Make sure your candy thermometer is working correctly before you try this recipe.

This is an unbelievable dessert. I have made this 3 times and each time it has come out beautifully. It not only tastes delicious, but looks absolutely spectacular. Folks cannot believe it is not store-bought ice-cream on the inside. This is an all-time Holiday Favorite!

This cake is remarkably good and remarkably easy given the spectacular results. The only fault I had in the recipe when I first made it (in the summer) was that the instructions didn't tell you it would melt like ice cream. As long as you keep it in the refrigerator it's fine. It has become something that I'm regularly requested to bring. Everyone loves it. As to the crust--I agree with the review who said the picture looks like a graham cracker crust and the directions call for chocolate wafers. I've been using chocolate graham crackers. Though the best thing I've used and what I sue all the time now is Teddy Grahams. Best flavor I've had for the crust. Also, it's easier if you get a wisk with a thermometer built in the handle. They sell them at Williams Sonoma for about $24.

My family has a history of eating peppermint stick ice cream with hot fudge sauce, so when I saw this recipe, I had to make it. It was wonderful. I did double the peppermint extract and actually thought it could use even more. Unfortunately, the green extract mixed with the red candies to make the ice cream orange. I didn't really like the peppermint pieces on top; they got a little chewy as they sat in the freezer (it took many days to eat the whole thing).

This was absolutely awsome! The presentation was spectacular even without putting additional candies on top. It was just rich enough for those of us who love chocolate and the peppermint was even settling on a full stomach. It was much easier to make than I thought it would be and I will definitely make this again and again!

Yum! I took someone else's suggestion and doubled the amount of peppermint extract in the filling. I also used Oreos to make the crust. I used 30 Oreos and 10 tablespoons of butter to make the crust, also omitting the sugar. Came out great. I would make it this way again.

I made this recipe over the holidays 4 different times and each time it was a hit. When serving I put the chocolate sauce in a squeeze bottle and did just a bit either on the plate or over top of the dessert. Then I added a small candy cane to the side. Great presentation!!! This will be a tradition for years to come for the holidays.

This is a wonderful dessert for Christmas or Christmas parties. The one thing the recipe does not say is how long the dessert should set out before serving, I set out 30 minutes and desset was slightly to soft to serve. Next time I will serve directly from the freezer. The crust is outstanding.

Everyone raved about this, didn't use the sauce. As to the crust, the picture looked like it was a graham cracker crust and the directions called for chocolate wafers, so I used chocolate graham crackers. One thing not mentioned in the recipe is that you should treat this cake like ice cream as it melts out of the freezer. Made it with another dessert that was a favorite of one of my guests (my mom). After tasting this my mom stayed away from her "favorite" dessert and only wanted seconds of this one. The next day she still only wanted this one and only began eating her "favorite" after this torte was gone. It's also easier to make than it looks and smashing as far as presentation.

I have made this for the last 6 years for Christmas and my family says it is a must every year. A new tradition!!! Everyone loves it, especially after a heavy meal. The chocolate sauce on the side is great but won't be missed if you opt not to do it.

I made this dessert for holiday party. I eliminated serving sauce on the side since it was on a dessert buffet. My one complaint is that the filling did not have a strong enough peppermint taste. I will add more extract next time.

This is an excellent desert for Christmas. The chocolate glaze and crust are out of this world. The filling is smooth and creamy. Make small slices because it's rich. However, some people do ask for seconds. My friends love this desert and it is a requested menu item around the holidays.

I have actually made this several times. The first was a dinner party where it recieved rave reviews. The second time I made it, guests from the last party told others how wonderful it was! Of course, there were no leftovers!! So simple- so divine!

This dessert reminded me of Frango brand candies. I found it very refreshing and filling! I did not have chocolate wafer cookies so I substituted Oreo's (1/2 bag) and skipped the sugar called for in the crust portion of the recipe. Thank you for this recipe!
