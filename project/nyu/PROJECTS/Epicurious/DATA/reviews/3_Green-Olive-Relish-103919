This relish makes the dish. It's heavenly, don't skip it.

Thought this was simple but so flavorful, especially with the risotto. I wonder if the earlier cook got real Meditteranean olives. I got a good quality one from a middle eastern market, and my guests really enjoyed it, even on the bread as a tapenade. Used lemon juice instead of zest since I didn't have time to grate, and it was still great.

This was delicious. It went quite well with the risotto. I'm not sure what went wrong with the person before me.

This looks interesting, but it has absolutely no flavor! It doesn't belong with the Mussels, Clams & Shrimp with Saffron Risotto recipe at all. There is no point to making this.
