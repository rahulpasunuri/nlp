Would recommend as a made ahead as it was a little much for this Easter morning. We did not use fresh dill and did increase egg mix by half (though did not pour all of it in). The texture turned out perfectly, but did require 10 more minutes of cooking. Wish I would have read the advice about adding some cheese. It was nice texture and flavor- very comfort food-- but could of used a little pizazz/zing.

Fantastic! I thought this recipe superb. Like others I increased the custard by half, turned out perfectly moist. The browned bread on top was yum! Used whole milk instead of half & half and it turned out great. Had some regular salmon I wanted to use, which I rubbed with Old Bay seasoning and briefly pan fried, then added large chunks before baking... think this added a lot of extra flavor!

Excellent casserole! Served it with sour cream I had mixed with lots of dill and capers for Christmas morning brunch and it was a hit. I made and baked it the same day.

I made this recipe as-is, and it was amazing. I thought the bread-and-potato combo sounded unnecessary, but kept both, and I'm so glad I did. I made it the night before, then got it out in the morning to bake. The bread had absorbed a lot more of the custard, so I was afraid that it might be dry and over-browned. Not so! The cubes on top got toasty and extra-delicious, even with my 10 min increase in baking time. Definitely use fresh dill--fresh makes this dish fabulous.

This was a huge hit for Christmas brunch, though admittedly, I personally would not call it fabulous. Everyone else raved about it, though. It was easy to make and flavorful. Next time I make it, I may add more eggs to make it more "egg-y" and "breakfast-y".

My two forks are because I didn't have fresh dill, sour cream and mustard. Instead my salmon was already seasoned with cajun spices and the recipe lacked depth of flavor. I'll make it again with the missing ingredients, less bread and potatoes and more custard. I had to bake it an hour, not just 30 minutes for the custard to set up.

What a great alternative to the usual breakfast casserole! I browned the potatoes in the oven. Toss the potatoes in olive oil and put them on a baking sheet; after the bread cubes were toasted, I cranked the oven to 475, and cooked the potatoes, turning a few times to evenly brown them. I just sauteed the shallots solo on the stove. Took advice of another review, and used smoked salmon from trader Joes, the filet NOT the sliced (like lox). Also, I did make it the night before and brought to room temp for 30 min, before baking this morning... super easy:)

I made this for a brunch and substituted chopped pancetta for the salmon (some guests did not like salmon). Left out the dill and added basil instead and it was a big hit.

The ROI on this was not sufficient. Add either celery seed or minced celery or bamboo shoots for texture. Not worth the expense, investment of energy and resources.

Following other reader reviews I increased the custard amount by 50% but kept the bread and potato quantities the same. Fed a group of 10, but could have made more--the dish was scraped clean. Delicious, simple, and anything that allows for do-ahead is a win in my household.

Thanks to other reader reviews and tips, this is a superb recipe. The extra custard and decreased amount of bread seems essential. The finished product was easy and delicious. I have a feeling this will become a Christmas morning staple in our house.

Made this for Christmas brunch -- very very good! I don't know one smoked salmon from another, so just used some from Trader Joe's. Despite some difficulty in flaking, the entire dish came together well -- added, per another's suggestion, 1/2 c. of grated gruyere and a bit more on top. Everyone loved it and now it's all gone.

This was very good! I asked a guest to bring it for Christmas Day brunch, and she ended not coming, so at the last minute, I made it myself so I had to do some substitutions: onions and garlic instead of shallots, flat-leaf parsley instead of chives, dried dill instead of fresh, and plain yogurt instead of sour cream. I deliberately left out the bread, and would do so again, as I don't think it's necessary with the potatoes. As such, I did not increase the custard as others recommend, but with the bread, I probably would. Plus, I like recipes in my box that are good make-aheads.

Based on the other reviews, I made a number of adjustments, which I think helped make a better dish (to my taste). Specifically, I cut out the bread, and increased the custard by 50%. Despite this, I found this to be a pretty bland and basic dish. FYI, I refrigerated overnight before baking.

I've made this dish 3 times, and each time it's been a big hit with my guests. I'm planning on making it again for Thanksgiving morning, since much of the prep can be done ahead, and then it's baked at the last minute.

A special make ahead brunch dish. I halved the recipe and baked in a 8x8 glass dish. It still makes plenty for 4-6. I did take other reveiwers' suggestions and upped the custard about by a quarter. I also "lightened" it up some by using evaporated skim milk instead of half & half and plain yogurt instead of sour cream. It still tastes greats -- just a little lighter. Also used red potatoes with the skin on. I think next time I might throw more chives and/or green onions. Goat cheese would also be a yummy addition.

I've made this dish several times at my husband's request. He takes it to work and it is devoured each time. I couldn't find "hot smoked" salmon, but used regualar smoked salmon. I agree that you need to increase the custard by 25%-50%.

I really had high hopes for this recipe, especially after reading the other reviews. I bought excellent hot-smoked salmon from a local smokery. I did use 50% more custard, but this dish was just good, not great. Took it to a work potluck, and though many other dishes were gone, this one had leftovers. (Chalk it up to uneducated palates.) It's also a bit heavy with both bread and potatoes.

Yummy Yummy. I brought this to the office and lots of people asked me for the recipe. I made the following changes: added 2 cloves of minced garlic, used smoked turkey instead of salmon, used frozen hash brown and I also increased the egg custard 25% more. I prepared everything the night before and baked it in the morning. This recipe is really easy to put together and very delicious. I will make it again.

This was super-yummy. My changes: - Olive oil instead of vegetable oil. - Added 2 cloves crushed garlic with the shallots. - Doubled the salt. - Increased the custard mix by 1/4, as suggested. - I forgot to buy sour cream, so I substituted mild goat cheese. - 10 minutes extra cooking time, which I covered the dish for.

I made this for mother's day brunch. I also incresed the egg mix 25% and am glad I did. I used red potatoes so I could keep the skin on. I used really good quality hot smoked salmon from whole foods, which I think really made a difference. I assembled it the day before and was really easy and great. Rich.

I served this for Easter brunch to an appreciative group. I had no fresh dill so substituted a dill dip mix which added a lot of flavor. I used cooked salmon from Trader Joe's which was easy and I used one of the mini baguettes from T.J.'s . I added a cup of Havarti with dill on top. I sauteed the potatoes in garlic olive oil and butter. It tasted great. It reheated well the next day. I was sorry to see it disappear.

This does make a lovely brunch dish, but it is essential to increase the custard by at least 25%, possibly by 50%. It's definately on the dry side. I bought very crusty baugettes and had a really hard time chopping them into cubes. Squishy supermarket baugettes would have been easier to work with.

Excellent dish; my friends and I loved it. This is also one of those clean-out-the-fridge meals that you can throw together anytime (provided you eat a lot of smoked salmon). Will definitely make again, though I may play with the spices, add cheese and possibly delete the bread. I didn't feel that it added much to the recipe.

We served this to our best friends for breakfast and we all loved it! I always read the reviews before using your recipes and added: 2 eggs, 1/2 c of half and half, and and 1 tsp of dijon mustard. I decided to add 1 cup of Havartai cheese, I'll add 1/2 more next time, and there will be a next time!

Although the dish is tasty, note that the recipe requires you to cut up baguettes in to 1/2 inch cubes (1/2 inch!), then toast them, making croutons. Waaaay too much work in my opinion. I wouldn't make it again except with store-bought croutons.

We had about 8 oz smoked salmon left from Seabolt outside of Seattle and decided to try this last night for dinner. It is delicious and would be very elegant for a brunch or breakfast. Followed the recipe exactly but increased the custard by 25% like one review suggested and it was perfect. We will make this again. The only reason we didn't give it a 4 is the fat content. For a special occasion it is wonderful.

I agree with Winnipeg, I found it a bit dry as well. Next time I would add some extra milk or half and half to make it more moist. PS- I also made a version with diced honey ham that was tasty.

I made this dish and my girlfriend really enjoyed it. Like the previous reviewer, I made 2 pans and found that the "custard" was indeed lacking, so I just added 25% to the "custard" mix and all was fine. This is definitely going to be one of my favorite casserole dishes. Don't skip the sour cream and dills.

To a Cook from Brooklyn: Yes, this cooks up beautifully when prepared the day before. I suspect that it would also freeze well. (original review) This is just lovely. We just finished eating it for Christmas breakfast. It is light and flavorful and full of different textures. I used an Alaskan hot smoked salmon - actually from Seabear which the person from San Francisco noted (www.seabear.com). If I did not have access to hot smoked salmon I would probably use fresh salmon and saute the potatoes in bacon. Don't skimp on the extra sour cream and herbs on the side.

Wonderful recipe just as is, although a little caviar on the sour cream makes it very special. We had this for Christmas breakfast with Mimosas and we shall continue to do so every Christmas. Incidentally, I made it on Christmas Eve and baked it in the morning.

Served this at a Boxing Day (26 Dec) brunch. While one guest remarked it was like a baked omelet, all enjoyed it. Strong suggestion. Capers tend to dominate when used and are not, in my opinion, a very "brunchy" ingedient. I substituted salmon roe (think large red juicy caviar) in the sauce and WOW! Try it. Served with green salad and champagne.

I also made this for Christmas brunch and it was a huge hit with my family. I used yukon gold potatoes, also substituted 2% milk for the half and half and didn't miss the extra fat at all. As other cooks noted, the sour cream, caper and dill garnish is a must! I used hot smoked salmon from Harry and David that a friend had given me for Christmas and it was delicious. This will definitely become a permanent addition to our family's Christmas culinary traditions!

Rating: 3
I also made this for Christmas morning. Instead of hot smoke salmon I used smoked mackrel. I con't say I have ever seen hot smoked salmon on the shelves here, but mackrel is certainly very common. And for non-Americans, single cream is a good equivalent for half and half, and I use strained greek yoghurt instead of soured cream, as it has more of the texture of American sour cream and bakes well.

We too had this for our Christmas breakfast and it was enjoyed by all. Served with some fresh fruit, it was a perfect way to begin a crazy day. I used hot smoked salmon from a local source and some members of my family tried to ensure that there would be none left for the casserole! The flavors came together very well as is; that said, the next time that I make it I may try substituting fresh horseradish for the dijon just to give it a bit more bite. Definitely use the sour cream and herbs when serving - really enhances the overall taste.

This recipe was delicious! I made it for our Christmas party, and I had 3 different requests for the recipe. It was such a big hit with my husband that he requested it for dinner the next night. I was out of shallots and chives so I substituted white and green onions--still wonderful! I think I'll try it with chicken next time.

To the cook from Arlington: Hot-smoked salmon has a texture like a baked salmon. It is totally unlike the reddish, thinly sliced smoked salmon you see in the refrigerated case, often called lox or nova. That salmon is cold-smoked at about 100 degrees F and keeps an almost-raw texture. If you go to your supermarket or specialty food store and see a box of smoked salmon on the shelf (not refrigerated), that is hot-smoked. This is a great time of year to find it. With all due respect to Mr Dunlap, I think commercially-smoked salmon is great for recipes like this or for dips.

Rating: 0
Two comments about the comments: if fat content is a concern, fat-free half & half is available. 2) Commercial smoked salmon is as bad as canned; barely tell it from tuna. Cook on your Weber. Soak cedar plank 1/2 hour, put on grill over hot coals, when it smokes put salmon on it & cook 15 minutes.

For the cook in Arlington: hot-smoked salmon is flaky and smokey, more like a canned tuna texture. Not at all like lox-style salmon. I buy it from a mail order source called Sea Bear, located in WA. Their number is 1-800-645-FISH; maybe they can tell you if any stores in your area carry their products.

I would slightly increase the liquid amounts, if you like mushier casseroles. This is easy to put together, and tastes really nice with sour cream, dill, and capers sitting on top. I also used frozen hash browns to speed up prep time.
