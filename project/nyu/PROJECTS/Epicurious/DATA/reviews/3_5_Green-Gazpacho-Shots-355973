I made this delicious soup as an hors d'oeuvre, and everyone loved it! Instead of the sour cream I garnished it with a little crab salad mixed with cilantro and chives. It was the perfect little refreshing treat and it looks very elegant. I would definitely make this again!

This is a very tasty cold soup. I made it to test how it would work for a cocktail party. Mostly I just ate it out of a bowl (was even good the next day so potental make-ahead dish), but when I tried it in a shot glass the soup was not easy to sip. I'm going to work on how long to chop the veggies to make them easy for a shot. Also, my shot glasses were long and narrow. I might try to find some not quite as tall.
