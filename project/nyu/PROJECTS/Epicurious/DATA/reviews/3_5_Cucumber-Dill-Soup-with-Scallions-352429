I do not understand the rave reviews for this recipe--it tasted like a bowl of lightly seasoned buttermilk. There are some great chilled soup recipes on Epicurious, and I'll reserve my fresh ingredients for those.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and served it ice cold, but found it quite bland.

This was awesome! I'm not a big fan of buttermilk. Since they didn't have buttermilk at the store, I added 2 lemons to a measuring cup and filled the rest to 2 cups and allowed to sit for 15 minutes to make my own buttermilk. I used this plus 2 cups of regular milk, instead of the 4 cups of buttermilk called for in the recipe.

I would give this recipe NO spoons. This is the most bitter dish I have ever made in my life, and I'm thinking there must be a mistake somewhere in the ingredients. I feel like I just squeezed a lemon into my mouth. VERY disappointing!

This falls somewhere between a green, dilly gazpacho and a tzatziki soup... really yummy and very adaptable. I did use 5 english cucumbers and it was a LOT. Felt the soup might have been diluted by all of the watery cucs, so added juice of 2 more lemons and a bit more yogurt. Great easy summer soup!

"5 large cucumbers" is a bit vague for me--I worry only because it seems that cucumbers are the base of the soup, yet too many may render a watery consistency... Has anyone made this with English or hothouse cucumbers? 5 of those would be not only very pricey, but a pretty large quantity as well!

Made this last night for company, absolutley delicious. Put a dollop of plain yogurt in each bowl of soup and swirled around, very pretty. Had to make copies and share the recipe. Will definitely be making again.

In my experience dishes containing yogurt do not freeze well. The yogurt tends to separate on rewarming.

This sounds gorgeous and has all the flavours I love. But I would need to freeze it. Does anyone have an opinion about how well it might freeze?
