With this recipe, my first buttermilk biscuits turned out tasty! After reading the other reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 tbsp and formed 6 biscuits, not 4. I used 6 tbsp of good lard and 4 tbsp cultured butter. Next time I will brush the tops with egg wash as one cook suggested, because they turn out so pale (though bottoms were golden-brown). I also lined my baking sheet with parchment paper.

These are exceptionally good. I followed the recipe to a T, except I made 8 biscuits; 4 would have been HUGE. Yum yum. Really good with preserves!

At first the dough seemed awfully wet and wasn't sure how well it would do in the oven. I was pleasantly surprised. They tasted great and had a perfect biscuit consistency.

I am a novice at biscuits and was prepared to pitch them and get something store-bought but they were great. I cut them in 6 and they were still quite large. They were tender and moist and I served them as a base for strawberry shortcake and they were just the right amount of sweetness. Very easy and quick to make, I will use again

These were not exactly light...did not really rise much, but nonetheless were tasty. I mixed fresh blueberries, raspberries and blackberries with a simple syrup made with black raspberry jam, water, sugar and riesling. Yummy!

The biscuits really were delicious. The recipe made about 8 smaller biscuits, but it was plenty large enough for dessert. Also, I sprinkled some raw sugar on top before I baked them and it added the perfect taste and look to them. Wonderful accompaniment as a shortcake!

To a cook from Florida. Buttermilk is necessary for the recipe because the acid helps to activate the baking powder; making your biscuits rise during baking. Your substitutions would have worked if you had added a little lemon juice to your milk and allowed it to sit for a few minutes, thus making your own buttermilk. I urge you to try it one more time. These biscuits really are delicious.

Definitely don't make only 4 biscuits. I made 8 and it was more than enough. The biscuits were great, perhaps not the most scrumptious thing I'd ever tasted, but I would make it again.

OK - please, someone tell me what I did wrong - I have not made biscuits so many times - actually, I have only made "drop" biscuits and I have always liked them - but, they do not have butter in the recipe so I thought I would try these. OK - I did not have buttermilk so I used 1/3 cup whole milk and 1/3 cup half and half -put the dry and the butter in the processor - real easy. Then the milk - real easy - but I must say, I thought they were quite tasteless and bland even though a few of you thought they were sweet. Well, I did not do four but rather cut them into 8 pieces round - left them in for 20 minutes - and they were almost uncooked inside - really, moist so, I put them back in for anothe 20 minutes - they browned nicely both top and bottom but even after cooling, the inside was flat and doughy, not at all puffed up or anything. So ladies, what the heck did I do wrong, or, is this the way they are supposed to be?? I did eat a few with some butter, preserves and milk but honestly could not see how you were all so CRAZY about them. Is this the way regular biscuits are supposed to be ? And, the inside, is that the way it should be, flat, moist, .... Sorry for the long post but I do love biscuits - they are so easy to make when you are in the mood but I was so disappointed because I was anticipating something different. Thanks for your responses.

These were wonderful-we have awesome strawberries this time of year here, so they were a no-brainer. Loved the buttery goodness of the biscuits-did use Splenda instead of sugar-after all, every little bit helps-and they came out wonderfully. Will make again for sure.

You can make these biscuits in the food processor, which is much easier. I added a tablespoon of chopped fennel seeds, and that took the recipe from really good to fabulous.

Absolutely loved these biscuits as a base for fresh fruit tossed with a bit of sugar. All that butter is worth it! They're a touch sweet, so I'd probably save these for a dessert, or maybe breakfast, rather than use them to accompany a savory main dish. Also used a pastry blender to cut in the butter--I find it works better.

This is the best biscuit I've ever had - and it works perfectly as a side for beef stew, or as a topping for the 1985 Chicken Pie (pot pie) recipe on Epicurious. My only recommendation is to add a little more salt to the dough, otherwise it's slightly bland. I also usually double the recipe and make large biscuits, so it's then necessary to bake them longer. Other than that, a great recipe!

at 2-1/2 T of butter per biscuit (not counting what goes on after they come out of the oven), these better be ambrosia. I'm afraid to try...

Made these for Thanksgiving dinner ~ what a hit ~ everyone from adults to 3 year olds gobbled them up, and I was pronounced the "family biscuit maker". They're big and knobbly and moist and so easy to make. I can see making these again and adding herbs for a twist. Enjoy!!

These biscuits are fabulous. They are not light, in fact, rather heavy but they fall apart and melt in your mouth. They are definitely my new standard biscuit recipe. By the way, I used the 'ol milk with vinegar in it trick since I didn't have buttermilk.

I know it's ridiculous to give a biscuit four forks, but they really are wonderful. I found these through the strawberry shortcake recipe, and use nothing else for shortcake (or biscuit-cake) recipes anymore. Just made stawberry-rhubarb shortcake on these a few weeks ago. Also great with breakfast. Must add these to your regular menu so you can impress friends the morning after a party or during a get away weekend!

This was my first attempt at biscuits from scratch and wow did I impress myself and friends. They were so light and tasty. They would make a great accompaniment to any breakfast meal, anything with gravy, the right soup, or just on their own. I used my food processor as recommended by others and it worked like a charm. I also used vegan butter and they turned out better than swell.

Great biscuits for taste, but not the most appealing appearance. Probably great served as biscuits and gravy. However, will try rolling them out next time.

I got to this recipe through a link for Stawberry Shortcakes. I made 5 biscuits, which were large. After 25 minutes, they were still gummy insude so I ended up cooking them about 35 minutes. Perfect, still light on top, golden on the bottom and rich. Delicious with my first Spring strawberries and whipped cream.

These were very good but I did not like their sweetness. I will use much less sugar next time. Other than that, they were quite good.

Good biscuit, very moist, easy to make. I probably wouldn't use it again for the strawberry shortcake - I prefer something more dense for that. But it would be great for breakfast.

These make great breakfast biscuit sandwiches with egg and bacon, and are also perfect for smothering in sausage gravy. Brushing the tops with egg before baking gives them a rich golden color.

I'm still new to making biscuits and this, unfortunately, is NOT the kind I like. I should have read through to see it would turn out pale. To me, that seems undercooked. I like them thick, flaky and browned.

Rating: 4
Like the other cooks, I made (6) biscuits instead of (4). However, instead of using (2) cups of all purpose flour, I used (1.5) cups and (.5) cup of cake flour. These biscuits came out light and fluffy and even made one co-worker get emotional.

I forgot to rate these biscuits last summer when I made the strawberry shortcake recipe this was included with. These biscuits are delicious!! I made four vs six - didn't have any trouble with them being doughy or anything - just the best! Will make again and again (& have) !

I made these for our traditional southern Christmas breakfast. (Country ham, sausage, red-eye gravy, etc.) These were the best bisuits I have ever made. Not only delicious but gorgeous looking as well. This recipe is a real keeper.

If you're looking for a flaky biscuit, this is not it. I agreed with another reviewer that they have a bit of a doughy taste; however, they were very good used in the strawberry shortcake recipe. I made 6 smaller biscuits and baked 20 minutes. Everyone loved them and I will definitely make again. VERY EASY to make, too!

Rating: 2
Given the rave reviews, I was disappointed. They were ok but had too much butter and did not rise enough. Rather hard crust (which my husband liked). I've compared this to other recipes and most have on the order of 6T butter.

I enjoyed these biscuits but they did have a quality I don't look for....a slightly doughy taste. They were light and tasty though. I can only give it 2 forks because they were not phenomenal but definitely good. I will certainly make them again but will continue to look for the perfect biscuit recipe. I don't know if this is because I'm a novice cooker (first time making biscuits). When I cook them again, if they're better, I will comment.

Mmmm. These were so good and so quick and easy. A great big biscuit that is very versatile. They tasted so good right out of the oven my husband and I ate two. I'm trying to restrain myself for tonight so I can make srawberry shortcake!

These are awesome! I made 8 smaller biscuits(instead of 4)and they were perfect for Thanksgiving dinner. I added a bit of fresh pepper and some dried thyme-just the right touch of flavor.

These biscuits are amazing. I made them with a big sunday dinner and they were a hit. I was immediately asked for the recipe and although none of us wants all the fat in our lives, we all agreed, sometimes you just have to! Everyone took a bite of the biscuits and just moaned over how wonderful they were.

I made this dessert for my husband's fifieth birthday (just the two of us). I used almost extract instead of vanilla in the whipped cream. In addition, I sprinkled fresh blueberries (for more color) into the strawberries when I served the dessert. Before dinner, I created a mis en place: I made the whipped cream and put it in the fridge; I had the strawberries soaking in the raspberry-sugar syrup; I rinsed the blueberries; and I sifted the dry ingredients for the shortcake together. After our main course, I finished compiling the shortcake, baked it, and served the dessert while the shortcakes were still warm. They were delicious. On Labor Day weekend, we're attending a family reunion where I'll prepare yet another variation of this recipe--using either peaches, nectarines or apricots as the local fresh fruit. I may also sprinkle slivered almonds on the dessert before using the powered sugar. The shortcake recipe is terrific!!! :-) Mickey

These are the best biscuits I have ever eaten! I come from a "southern" family where homemade buttermilk biscuits were made on a daily basis. This recipe beats all others hands down! I didn't have unsalted butter in my fridge, so used regular(sweet cream) butter instead. So awesome, I ate 3 of them right out of the oven!

This was my first time making biscuits, and the recipe turned out perfectly. I won't bother trying another recipe next time I make biscuits- I'll definitely use this again.

I've made this one two ways; once "as written", and once using plain, whole-milk yogurt thinned with a little extra milk to equal the quantity of buttermilk in the original. This recipe I did in a food processsor, using only pulses to avoid overworking the dough. The yogurt makes for a richer bisquit, still very crumbly and really delicious. Make a double batch... you'll want some for breakfast the next day!

Easy to make, comes out light and tasty - definitely a keeper.

This is the BEST and most classic, foolproof biscuit recipie! Perfect for so many dishes, or great by themselves. Flawless in strawberry shortcake~ they make the desert. Also, it makes a lot more than 4 (depending on how big they are of course), but I got about 7 out of one recipie, and they were average size.

My first attempt at home-made biscuits, and a great success. With no buttermilk in the frig, I had to use 2% and found that I didn't need the whole amount. Wonderful texture (crumbly) and buttery flavor. These will be made again, and I can't wait to try them with buttermilk

A simple, classic recipe for a great southern staple. This makes a wonderful, rich crumbly biscuit with a consistency similar to a scone.
