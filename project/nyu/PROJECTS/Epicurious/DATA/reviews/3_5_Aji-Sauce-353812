I made this sauce to accompany the beer marinated flank steak fajitas for a New years dinner party. However,we ate most of the sauce during the "tasting" phase of meal preparation. It was very good. I am making more sauce agin today as an afternoon snack for my five year old. If a kid loves it,it has to taste good!

I've had aji before, this is a variation. I guess it's a matter of preference (or region?). I made just as written and felt something was off. I added habenero for more heat, chopped tomato and olive oil for more texture and lime in addition to the vinegar. Still not as good, but an improvement.

Spicy! This sauce is HOT if you leave the seeds in, but totally delicious. I used the extra to dress a bean salad, and it was great. I think this sauce would free well and be good in ice cube trays so you could use a little at a time to add heat.

very mediocre. added a quarter of avocado to help out the initially watery texture, which in turn really toned the spice level down, too. it does look pretty, though, drizzled on top of flank steak!

Made this with the flank steak recipe it was amazing.

Really hot but quite taste. Huge hit. We will definitely make this again (with the flank steak recipe)

This is a great sauce / condiment for flank steak. I eyeballed the quantities of the ingredients for the small batch I made, using less jalapeno, more lime juice and no red wine vinegar. It was delicious! I used the leftovers as a dressing for a green bean salad.

This sauce is wonderful, we had it with the beer-marinated flank steak recipe, wonderful pairing. I used only lime juice, no red wine vinegar, and used a regular yellow onion, tasted great and the heat was just right, could not and would not want this to have a sweetness. I made this in the morning and had it 7 hours later which allowed the flavor to develop even more. I think this would be great mixed with avacado to make a yummy twist on regular guacamole.

This sauce is absolutely wonderful. Anyone who likes chimichurri would probably enjoy this. It is a wonderful compliment to beef and would probably taste great on other meats as well.

this is ok. I've made better salsa.

This is a easy sauce that pairs well with the beer-marinated flank steak with which I found the recipe. This is also great on sandwiches. I would not recommend using regular onions in lieu of sweet onions though. I was too lazy and just used what was on hand. I ended up adding a little sugar to take off some of the bite. I won't do that again.

I thought this sauce would be too hot, but it was perfect! I am looking forward to trying it with different meats! I used half lime juice and then half vinegar, as most of the recipes I found called for both.

The sauce was delicious with the steak, but the combination of chopping the onions & jalapenos was rough. In case you're not familiar with cooking with hot peppers (as I wasn't) wear gloves for this!

We've made this several times and it is fantastic; the flavors are fresh and lively. It is intended to have the some texture and I don't find that a distraction. I can see how the addition of mayo might make this more palatable to some. This needs grilled meat for balance, it should not be expected to stand on its own.

As written, the sauce is a little grainy and thin. I had made aji before from other recipes online. Their secret: mayo. I added a heaping tablespoon or so, and it binded up perfectly. People went crazy for it at our BBQ (they put it on chicken). Two forks as written, four with the mayo.

This was VERY spicy on its own. I thought we wouldn't be able to use it BUT combined with the Flank Steak and the Guac it was exceptional! I will be making this again.

this sauce is pretty potent on it's own...but added to the flank it was really good.

Made this to accompany the beer marinated steak. It was good, nothing spectacular.
