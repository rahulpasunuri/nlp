Haven't made it yet, but feel there's an error in the instructions as there's no mention of the egg. I'm assuming it's added to the cream cheese and will do so.

The review is just for the sauce as I had some leftover canned pineapple to use up. I substituted arrowroot for the cornstarch (allergy) and used more juice and less water. Served the sauce over some good vanilla ice cream; it was light tasting and delicious.

The sauce is great.....don't know about the cheesecake recipe as I made "Italian Summer Cheesecake instead" using an arrowroot bisquit 'crust'. Also offered raspberry puree for those that did not care for pineapple.

Where is the pumpkin cheesecake Martin Sheen refers to in the November 2002 issue?
