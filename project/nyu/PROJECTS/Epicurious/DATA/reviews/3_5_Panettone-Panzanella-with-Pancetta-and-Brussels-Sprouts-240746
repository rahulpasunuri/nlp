Used this recipe for a large scale catering event as a fill in salad. Wasn't too sure that it would go over because of the brussel sprouts, [which I love] but, the salad was a big hit with the client. Didn't change a thing

This was an awful lot of work for something that really is just ok. Maybe I would have liked it more had it not taken me so long to make... also, this made a very large amount - more like 8-10 servings in my opinion - and you better finish it up the first time serving it. I thought it had too much (and too large of pieces) panettone. Again, it was fine/good, but nothing spectacular at all... and I love brussels sprouts normally and anything made with them. My husband tried to be impressed... but it just isn't an impressive dish. Too much work for something that's just so-so.

This was excellent, although a lot of work to make. Couldn't find panettone or raison challah so used regular challah with dried cranberries. Took advice of prior reviewers and increased the sprouts but thought there could have been even more. Also, roasted rather than boiled the sprouts (easier and better tasting). Next time would make the croutons a little smaller, and fewer (or would increase the sprouts). Might also halve rather than quarter the sprouts. The vinaigrette is just delicious, and the combination of the pancetta (and by the way seems as if cheaper bacon might be just as good), the dressing, and the sprouts is very satisfying. Great winter side dish especially for rich meaty dishes. Almost a meal on its own.

My husband and I just had this for lunch with a glass of Chardonnay - it was delicious. For the vinaigrette, i substituted a pear for the apple and did not saute it as it was ripe (soft) enough. i also did not have any shallots so i used a very finely chopped red onion. agree with another reviewer, next time i will do more brussels in the ratio of ingredients. i can't get enough of them this winter!

I did this last night for a New Year's dinner with the whole family and everybody was intrigued and delighted with this. Quite a bit of work though, but worth the effort for something different on your table!

this is an incredible dish and was the favorite dish at christmas dinner. i don't like boiled brussel sprouts or raw radicchio, so i roasted the vegetables, marinating them in apple cider vinegar and minced garlic for an hour before roasting. i recommend increasing the vegetable quantities to 2 lbs brussel sprouts and 1 lb. radicchio. i toasted the panettone longer than recommended, but 6 mins. is probably a better time. the panettone should be somewhat soft for this dish, not a real croton; a good, untoasted panettone has wonderful texture and should not be lost entirely. the apple vinegrette was surprisingly simple and straightforward in ingredients, but so delicious in taste and married the flavors of the vegetables w/ the panettone "perfectly." i used 5 oz. of prosciutto and sliced into thin slices to cut back on fat and cost.

Everyone raved over this salad at Thanksgiving, and I will make this for Christmas by popular request!
