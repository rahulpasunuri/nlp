Its recipes like this that makes me realize what an inexperienced baker I am. Is it my cheap electric oven that my landlord insisted on installing so he wont have to pay my gas bill? Or is it the dark colored sheet pan I used? I thought the classic crumbly shortbread texture was great, but zesting those limes made head straight to the store afterward and invest in a rasp. Even though I and my roommates have eaten almost all the cookies, they were thin, too brown and because I deemed them ugly decided NOT to bring them to the party they were intended for. Next time I think I will double the recipe, add a bit more zest now that I have my rasp, and bake on a lower temperature to avoid the browning. I hope the second time around will allow me to add extra forks to my overall review.

These are my "go to" freezer cookies. I put all the lime zest in the cookie dough, it only takes a couple of minutes to put all in the blender, then roll. I wrap well: waxed paper, foil, then zip-lock freezer bag. they keep well for a long time in the freezer. leave out for a few minutes to soften slightly before slicing. 325 for ~ 15 min. I try to keep a couple of choc. bars around to melt in the microwave for topping. great for last minute.

I made these and they turned out really nice. I couldn't really taste the lime though with the frosting though they were still very good.

I tried making these a little while ago. I'm just getting into cooking, and at the time I wasn't even sure what shortbread was supposed to look like. They tasted good, but were far too dry and crumbled with the slightest touch. I think the recipe may have been to dry perhaps, but I couldn't even serve these because they kept falling apart.

These are the best and very impressive looking, but easy to make and so delicious. Where ever I take them everyone wants the recipe.

I made substitutions. I suplimented with lime juice because I didn't have enough zest. I didn't use white chocolate because I never touch the stuff. Instead I made a sugar/lime juice glaze and poored it over the toasted almonds. A little crumbly but they taste great.

I loved this recipe. A few changes though. I rolled the dough and cut like previously suggested but I also melted the white chocolate w/ lime zest and added 1-2 T butter. After the chocolate cooled and thickened a bit I spread the chocolate mixture on like icing. They were delicious, fast and easy.

These are fantastic.I also rolled dough into a log.They do not spread when baked.Do not skimp on the lime zest.I also agree with putting last zest in white chocolate.Rather than almonds, I toasted and crushed hazelnuts.I made them this a.m. and they are gone.

These were a big hit at the office. I made as directed, but as another reviewer suggested, next time I'll make a log and slice rounds. Tasty and not "run of the mill." Will make again.

I've always been afraid of shortbread. Would it be hard, tough, chewy?? So I never made it before. But I tried this and I was rewarded with a tender, melt in your mouth shortbread. Thank you

i made these last night and the were amazing! my only sugestion is instead of sprinkling the zest on top of them i put them in with the white chocolate while they were over the double boiler. the heat of it brought out more of the zest flavors. but eather way this recipi is amiazing

I made them this week and they were delicious. They would be fun for a party with a tropical theme. the lime wasn't overpowering and the cookie itself wasn't too sweet. Very yummy.

These are easy and great! Took 'em to work and they were scarfed up immediately. Next time would pat into a round rather than use the baking pan - I think I could get more uniform thickness that way. I like another reviewer's idea of the slice and bake, too.

These are super tasty! When I tried to cut through the dough before putting it in the oven, it was too crumbly. So I took it out of the oven halfway through the baking time and cut it then, and it worked great!

YUMMY! So easy and so delicious. Rave reviews from everyone who tasted them. East too. I found that I didn't need all the melted white chocolate. . .would halve it next time.

Instead of making these in pan, I rolled the dough into a log and froze it for 30 mins, then sliced into cookies. Baked at 325 for 25 mins. Yum!

Made these exactly as written. Very delicious. Thought they would have more lime flavor, but it was enough for just a hint. Maybe it was because I used a microplane, and the peel was very finely grated.

These are fabulous. My oven runs too hot to bake at 325 for that long, so I reduced the heat to 310 after the edges began to brown at 20 minutes. They turned out perfectly. Wow! How good!
