Love the combination of flavors! Everyone raved about the meal, even a few days after.

Heat my oven to 500 degrees in the middle of summer? Ha! I used a double thickness of heavy duty foil and put it on the grill. I turned up the foil on the edges about and inch to create a "pan". Took about 25 minutes. Be sure to boil down the juice/sugar liquid. I got impatient and didn't cook it long enough. Overall, it was ok.

Super yummy and easy! I loved the cilantro--added a great freshness. I added a couple of pineapple slices over the top during baking--mmmm. Baked asparagus drizzled with olive oil was over the top! Will do again.

I tried to cook this as a 2 lb pork loin roast in my rotisserie. Glaze was not quite thick enough to stick well. And the glaze had barely a trace of pineapple flavor. Pork was very moist, so overall it was fine.

To A Cook on 09/22/09; if you carefully compare the grammar of the ingredients list with your own sentences, you will have your answer. 2 3/4 pounds (plural) tenderloin vs. 2 3/4-pound (hyphen singular) tenderloins (plural).

Simple to prepare and just the right amount of kick. I halved the recipe for my husband and me. With regard to another reviewers concern about the internal cooking temperature...you should remover the pork when it reaches 145 degrees and then let it rest, covered, for ten minutes. This will finish cooking the meat and bring the temperature to 160 degrees.

javascript:void(0); The glaze is really tasty and makes the dish. Plus the dish was super easy and didn't take long to prepare. I had never made pork tenderloin before and this worked out very well.

Seriously, one of the best pork dishes I have ever eaten. I tasted the glaze before I applied it to the pork and was very skeptical... but the flavors mixed together with the pork was AMAZING!!!!!

Followed the instructions to a T. It came out perfect. Make sure your fold aluminum foil over the walls of the roasting pan to make clean up easier. Cooking to 145 degrees made the pork perfectly white in the center.

Changed the recipe around a bit. Used crushed pineapple instead of just juice so it made more of chutney (?). Used 1/3 of the sugar and probably didn't even need it. Would use a little less allspice next time and maybe a more jalapeno. Poured the "chutney" over chops and baked for 12 minutes. Perfect.

This is a delicious recipe. Although, I'm not sure who said that pork is done at 145 degrees F -- the safe temperature for pork doneness is 160, so naturally it does take a few minutes longer than 15 minutes. The glaze was sweet and spicy but the drippings burned in the baking sheet while cooking, filling my kitchen with smoke. Maybe next time I'll have to let the glaze thicken a little before brushing onto the meat.

On what planet does this cook in 15 minutes??? I am dropping the heat down to 425 in hopes I don't dry this sucker out, and cooking for another 20 mins or so.

I thought it was delicious and the pineapple added a nice flavor to the pork. I would definitely make it again.

I read the reviews before making it, and after making it, I'm not sure what I did right (or others did wrong). I'm a horrible, horrible cook (read: 28 single male), usually burn everything, undercook meat, and make a mess in the process. I layered my baking sheet with tinfoil. No mess, super, super easy cleanup. I added a little extra lime juice to my glaze, and also went for green jalepeno peppers for an extra kick. Good choice. The cilantro seemed like an afterthought and didn't do much to the flavors, but the glaze was delicious, and it managed to permeate the meat. I'll definitely make this again.

I was really dissatisfied with this recipe. The flavours didn't permeate the meat at all. I used high quality ingredients, and it still came out bland. Add the huge mess it made (even with the foil) and it was totally not worth the trouble.

unfortunately I wasn't a big fan of this dish. maybe I did something wrong. Wouldn't make it again.

My husband and I really liked this dish. It was messy and hard to clean up, but that can be easily rectified with better prep in the future. I also used regular jalapenos instead of red ones. Highly recommend, but use foil, foil, and more foil to aid with clean-up.

To those of you who've prepared this dish, what quantity of pork did you use? Did you prepare a full 2.75 lb of pork tenderloin, OR two 3/4 lb tenderloins? This seems like a lot of pork per serving if this is meant to serve 4. Thanks.

I made this with Chicken and broccoli; my boyfriend LOVED it! However, I didn't know you were suppose to use gloves when prepping the peppers. My hands burned for 3 hours; good thing the meal was delicious! USE GLOVES!

Enjoyed recipe. I didn't want to heat my oven to 500 degrees on a warm day. I followed the cooking directions of the Island Pork Tenderloin, my favorite pork tenderloin recipe. Browned tenderloin, roasted at 350 with sauce. We thought it was very good. Perhaps I will try the hotter oven method this winter. Also we like spicy, so I will probably add a little more next time. Served with rice pilaf, baby greens with Asian/ginger. dressing.

quick, easy, and delicious. what more could you ask for? It was great with cilantro rice and a cucumber salad. The only change we made was grilling the tenderloins instead of roasting them. I'm already planning to make this again for our end of summer cookout.

I did not like this recipe. It was bitter (partly due to burnt sauce) but all in all I would not make this again nor would I recommend the recipe.

Loved this recipe. Very moist and tender pork and the glaze was perfect. I put down one layer of reynold's wrap and wished I would have put down 2 layers. The glaze gets baked into the dish and can burn easily. One way to help mitigate this is to use a turkey baster and re-glaze throughout the baking process.

Very good. I had trouble getting the sauce to reduce and I would add more jalapenos, but it was still delicious.

A delicious dish that appears simple, but does require some careful preparation. I had to substitute green jalapenos for the red variety called for in the recipe. Next time, I would probably use more jalapenos for extra spice. I ran into some trouble when boiling the pineapple + sugar mixture which resulted in a messy boil-over scenario. Additionally, the glaze was burning in the bottom of the baking sheet causing some smoke issues in the kitchen. Despite these problems, this dish was a great success. Moist and tender pork with a delicious sweetness. Would definitely make this again.

Killer! Made pretty much as directed, but wanted more pineapple flavor in the glaze so I used more pineapple juice and less sugar, and reduced over the stove to bring the glaze to a nice thick consistency. Coconut rice is a nice accompaniment.

I really liked this recipe. I added fresh peaches on top (not cooked) and we thought it really added to the dish.

Delicious! Anything glazed with pineapple has my vote but this tastes so perfectly delectable and was so easy to make I felt like I wasn't doing any work at all!! I will definitely make this again sometime!

This was delicious! I did not have any allspice so I omitted that but I would try it next time. Even so, it was yummy. The cilantro on top offset the sweetness of the sauce perfectly. Great flavours.
