I ignored all the reviews that said it was bland and went ahead with the recipe and even added extra spices and chicken broth. It was VERY bland and time consuming. I would not bother with this again. If you insist, and your diet permits, I would add bacon or some meat.

This is a delicious recipe that should definitely be made when you have time on your hands, i.e. on a Sunday afternoon while the football is on. It takes about 3 hours to complete the whole dish from chopping all the veggies to baking everything. But it is sooooo worth it. I did use veggie broth and I did increase the amount of herbs to put in (more rosemary, parsely, and I used celery salt)... but like all good cooks I tasted everything as I went so I knew if I had to add more salt or pepper or rosemary. The biscuits came out perfect-- but same advice: you can add more herbs to taste (even chives! or a little bit of sugar). This is a perfect perfect winter recipe. So filling and relatively easy even though it takes a long time. Try it!!

So tasty and easy to make. Easy, but could be time consuming. I made this in stages. YUM. I'd maybe mix in some chia seeds to the vegetables and make the biscuit topping with some wheat flour. Nice and hardy and makes plenty.

Very nice dish, good vegetarian choice when cooking for non-vegetarians. And best of all: my picky boyfriend ("this painstakingly poached salmon has 'too many flavours'") loved it! I did more than double the amounts of herbs and added dried thyme to the vegetables. I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the biscuits, but I still thought they were a bit bland. Great idea though, next time i'll try adding just a pinch of sugar or honey I think. I have a hunch it will brighten 'm up.

My boyfriend and I made this and it was absolutely delicious. Following recommendations from other reviews, we increased the parsley and rosemary, as well as used vegetable broth instead of bouillon. The cook times do look daunting, but we worked around it by getting some chores done while it was baking. Totally worth the wait. I can't wait to make it in the winter for a cozy dinner!

The poor reviews were read was a warning sign, as was the fact that only 72% of people said they would make it again. But still I had hope in this recipe - and that hope got me a labor-intensive, bland meal. I followed other reviewers who suggested not to simmer the veggies at the start. Unfortunately some of my veggies remained pretty hard in the pie, so that step may be worthwhile. But this pie needs some more flavor. I found myself wishing I'd made a chicken pot pie - less work, more flavor.

My husband and I both thought this was delicious and very flavorful! I did modify the filling recipe slightly based on other reviewers suggestions and the ingredients I had on hand. I used approximately 1 tablespoon each of chopped fresh thyme and rosemary, and substituted light cream and dry white wine for the heavy cream and sherry. As suggested I did not simmer the chopped root vegetables before adding them to the sauce; however, I did bring the bouillon base and water to a boil, then added the dried porcini mushrooms so that they could re-hydrate while I sautéed the onions. (I did not strain the mushrooms from the broth before adding to the onions.) I made the biscuit topping exactly as instructed, and baked filling and topping for the full amount of time. This recipe does take a while to make, although after it goes in the oven much of that time is passive.

This dish was good. I made it pretty much as written, subbing only pre-made vegetable stock for vegetarian bouillon and water. As recommended by other reviewers, I increased the rosemary a lot (I purchased one of those packages of organic fresh herbs and used all of it between the pie and the biscuits). The pie has a good, comfort-food flavor to it, and the biscuits were delicious. However, this was an incredibly labor-intensive and time consuming dish to make, and, as other reviewers stated, I just don't think it was good enough to justify almost 4 hours of my Sunday.

I made this with my family for Thanksgiving. It was DELICIOUS!! We used dried shitake mushrooms and doubled the amount of fresh rosemary in both the filling & the biscuits. We also like our food spicy, so we were generous with the pepper. The prep is labor intensive. But I disagree that this dish is bland. One word... YUM.

Way too much work for way too little result. A definite taste-deficit.

I agree with the reviewers who said this was kind of bland. My husband said, "it's nothing to write home about" and I have to agree. It did solve my problem, however, of what to do with the leftover rutabaga and parsnips in my fridge.

I'm sorry but no one in my house liked this except for my dogs.

One of my regular winter side dishes is roasted root vegetables prepared in a very similar way as this recipe. I made this dish as a way of using up my left-overs. This is a great way to go and will save your patience from being pushed too far in one sitting. Since we had roasted a chicken with the veggies a day or so before, we tried some leftover chicken in some of the individual pot pies I made with this recipe. Delicious! I would recommend trying this recipe in this way. Also - I used plenty of fresh chopped thyme when I roasted the vegetables, which may have helped my version to be as full-flavored as it was.

This is the perfect recipe to make in blizzard weather! Made this during the Snowpocalypse 2010 winter storm and blizzard that hit DC area in Feb, and this recipe certainly helped with the cabin fever! I used a sweet potato instead of rutabaga, a Trader Joe's pouch of mixed dried mushrooms instead of porcini, and yogurt instead of buttermilk for the biscuits. Even with doubling dried rosemary for fresh, though, I found this to be too bland for my taste, and too time consuming to repeat, even with skipping the boiling part...

i agree that this recipe takes a long long time if you follow the recipe verbatim. i also agree with many reviewers that you can forgo the boiling in the beginning and half the baking time. i do disagree with many people that said this was bland. i thought it was spot-on hearty winter yumminess! next time i make this i will consider roasting the veggies for 20 min. at 450 deg. and then incorporating them into the sauce/stew before baking. i also might add some additional fresh mushrooms, like baby bella or shitake.

Loved this! Would definitely double or triple the herbs and garlic, and I might try swiss chard instead of mushrooms for color and texture. Be careful not to overboil your roots. Next time I might skip the boiling altogether. I only baked this for about 30 minutes total and it came out just fine.

I was glad I doubled the herbs. Used half spelt flour, half white wheat for the biscuits, which worked well. Overall the dish was bland and odd tasting. I would use the biscuit recipe again but not the rest.

I made this for my book group and it got rave reviews! The buttermilk biscuits were really delicious, and the porcini mushrooms lends a deep and rich flavor to this vegetarian meal.

This is a very tasty recipe. While it does take a long time to prepare (not a quick weeknight meal), it is a hearty and delicious fall meal. We enjoyed it the night before Thanksgiving!

Great recipe. Be careful not to add too much flour - it is hearty enough. And I would increase anything that offsets the simple flavors of the root vegetables... spices, sherry, broth, etc. And I agree - the dumplings make the recipe :)

I like this one with the directions as written, but modify the root-veggies to your taste. I do enjoy celery root, but it has a strong flavor. Parsnip is so mild it's good advice to double that and leave out the celaric if you want a milder dish. It works with the shorter cook time as suggested, but I like the veggies caramelized, so I make this when I'm also cooking other things for the week, and leave it in for the full time as written. My family likes it.

i agree with a cook from seattle - bland and not worth the effort. i was SO excited to try this but was very disappointed in the final product. also found the cook times extremely off - both times my cook time was half of that written. i think some elements could be re-worked into an awesome pot pie - the rosemary biscuits and the creamy base, but i found the veggies too singular in flavor. however, i did get to buy and cook some root veggies for the first time and that was cool - rutabaga, celeriac and turnip. though the celery root is one i could live with never eating again!

I agree with others that this recipe takes time... perhaps doing some of the prep in advance would help. My husband and I used whole wheat flour for the biscuits and that was a mistake. Next time, we'll use regular. We also forgot to get the mushroom, so we used a few dried shiitakes we had on hand, but it would definitely be better with more. Overall quite good, though. We'll make it again!

we really enjoyed this recipe, but would leave out the celery root next time- the flavor is too intense (maybe we just don't like celery root?). it definitely takes a while- almost 4 hours total- but the recipe makes a huge amount- easily dinner for 8.

bland and not worth the time and effort to make it.

This is absolutely delicious. I caramelized all the vegetables in a bit of olive oil before adding them to the boiling bouillon. Next time, I'll skip the boiling/draining step - doesn't really seem necessary. I'll also soak the porcinis separately and add some sliced shiitakes. The biscuit topping adds a lot to the dish. I found that I didn't need anywhere near the amount of buttermilk given in the recipe.

The flavor of the stew was wonderful, although left out the mushrooms and added some swiss chard, and half and half instead of heavy cream because that's what I had on hand. However, I found the biscuits to be very heavy and doughy - more like dumplings than biscuits. But, it's my first attempt at biscuits so maybe I did something wrong. Maybe the food processor is not the way to go? I'll find a different biscuit topping that's lighter for the next round. My boyfriend LOVED it as is.

With a vegetarian daughter and a meat- loving husband, I am always trying to find the perfect main course that my husband won't notice is lacking meat! This is it! He loved it!! It is really absolutely delicious. I left out the rutabaga, used an extra parsnip, substituted sliced white mushrooms, pre-cooked them til the liquid was evaporated, then sauteed with the garlic and onion. Doubled the rosemary, felt it needed more. Added s & p to the vegetables as well. I think the 50 minutes the vegetable filling is in the oven carmelizes the lot and really adds to the flavor. Frankly it was a lot of work, next time I would prepare it over two days, but really well worth it!

I really liked this dish. It is a great comfort dish for the middle of winter. The biscuit topping adds alot to the stew. I used regular mushrooms instead of the dried ones and also added some frozen spinach. I'll definitely make this again.

I did not prebake the filling as suggested. Instead, I topped the unbaked filling with the raw biscuit dough and baked the whole thing, once, for 50 minutes. It turned out great this way (and saved almost an hour of my time). Also, this dish stores well. I froze extra servings, thawed them in the fridge for a day before reheating, and it turned out just as tasty as when freshly prepared.

i am always looking for something new and impressive to serve to vegetarian friends, and this recipe is perfect. i followed the recipe pretty closely- added a little extra rosemary and some thyme to the filling and substituted potato for the rutabaga b/c my store didn't have any. it took a while, but most of the time was inactive time- once you prepare the filling it just needs a lot of time in the oven. b/c you can prepare the filling in advance it's great for company. my guests were really impressed. for health reasons, i will try halving the butter in the filling and maybe using less cream. but i will definitely be making it again...

I found this a bit on the bland side, as if it was missing some seasoning. I'd amp up all the herbs next time, as well as the salt. With those changes, I'd imagine it a keeper at three forks.

Warning - this does take a LONG time. It is worth it! The veggies caramelize and are so sweet and yummy. The biscuit is also delicious. Changes: I'm not a dried mushroom fan, so I sauteed fresh and then went on with the recipe. Also not a turnip fan, doubled the parsnips.
