I made this as a birthday cake, using a Spongebob-shaped tin instead of the 13 x 9 in the recipe. I had no buttermilk, so I used milk with a little lemon juice added to it instead. I also left out walnuts in case of any nut allergies. It was easy to make - I particularly like using zucchini. The cake turned out wonderfully. Moist, and the chocolate chips give it a very rich decadent taste. I will use this recipe again for a birthday cake.

I love this recipe,or template since I did make changes. Used slightly more cocoa, and less sugar (1 1/4 cups) substituted applesauce for the oil, and mixed half the chips and nuts in the batter and placed the rest on top. If I didn't bake it myself and know that there was zucchini in it you'd never know by tasting which is good and bad (I do like zucchini) But this is a fantastic chocolate cake.

So rich, moist and delicious!!! I did increase cocoa powder to 3/4 cup and used bittersweet chocolate chips. Many wanted the recipe!

Cooking for a friend and her family...she has cancer, and volunteers try new things that are healthy and fun. Our company has an employee garden, so got some lovely summer squash and used in this recipe. I too substituted apple sauce for half of the fat...1/2 c natural applesauce for the oil. In addition, didn't add nuts, and mixed chocolate chips throughout the batter. Beautiful Bundt cake that is now dusted with powdered sugar and ready to go to my friend's family!

This WAS our favourite Zucchini Cake recipe until 2 of our family were diagnosed with gluten and dairy allergies. I've made this cake gluten and dairy free with the following substitutions: For flour substitute an equal amount Bob's Red Mill Gluten free flour mix. Add 3/4 tsp. xanthan gum & 1tsp baking powder. For butter, substitue Earth Balance vegan spread, for buttermilk, substitute hemp milk. Everyone, including gluten eaters, come back for seconds.

This is as good a chocolate cake as you can get and it has vegetables in it! Made as is, multiple times perhaps with a little more zucchini and routinely using half and half curdled with fresh lemon juice for the buttermilk since I dont stock that routinely. Sometimes even in a convection oven it takes more than 50 minutes. My husband says its addictive.

Superb. I had tried making chocolate zucchini bread once and wasn't thrilled with the results. Decided to give it another shot and boy, am I glad I found this recipe. I did increase the cocoa to 3/4 cup. And I forgot the chocolate chips! But it was absolutely TDF.

This is the same recipe my grandmother used to make. Moist and delicious. No need to change a thing really, but if you love chocolate, using an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa in place of some of the flour gives you an even more intense chocolate flavor.

Very good. I made cupcakes--I got 27 small ones, and they took longer to bake than some reviews indicated. You don't want to underocok this very moist batter. The premium chocolate chips I used did not melt into a glaze in the 30+ minutes I baked the cupcakes, though, and the flavor wasn't quite as intense as some predicted. I did make one change: I used pure vanilla, and as I always do, I used less than the vanilla extract amount. I'll try the full teaspoon next time and hope for a little more depth. And perhaps minichips would work better for cupcakes, with their shorter baking time. All this said, these are tasty little morsels, similar in size and potential uses to but better than "two-bite brownies" that come from the organic food store.

O M G !! As suggested..I fought my 'tweaking' urge and made the fundamental recipe as suggested. To satisfy my control urges I made it in my trusty old pyrex round baking dishes..dividing the batter between the two. I grated the zucchini fine. Only adjustments to the recipe were extra toasted pecans and extra quality dark mini chips sprinkled on top. I wish I could upload a photo... the cake is visually stunning...the layers rose wonderful with a chocolate nut crust. I made a simple choc ganache (with touch of bourbon and hazelnut liqour)cooled it then whipped to near fudge stage... used it to fill the laters and do sides... set roasted pecans around the edge of cake. Perfect. But the true test... taste...as posted..it is like a fudge cake...I think the grate of the zucchini makes a big dif. I over did mine a bit and it is still moist and satisfying. I can picture serving this basic cake warm from the oven with a soft homemade ice cream or hand whipped cream as well if you prefer rustic. One of the best cake recipes, PERIOD This recipe is moving to the top of the cake list !! Happy Cooking :)

Made exactly as specified. This has a "dark chocolate" taste and is not sweet. Suggest making exactly as specified. This is one of the top recipes that I"ve made from this web site. There is virtually no taste of zucchini....it makes more of a dark chocolate treat suitable for adult tastes.

Yep, if you start making substitutions, don't blame the recipe. Honestly, this cake was delicious. It was most and super chocolatey. I didn't include the walnuts and made it in a round cake pan. But, otherwise, the recipe is bang on. Also, I slathered it with a brown sugar icing. Didn't need it, but was delicious.

I'm so disappointed -- the cake is lovely and moist, but not tasty! I decided not to rate the cake because I made so many changes: I doubled the recipe, subbed 1/3 of the white flour with wheat, cut the sugar by 1/4, and subbed plain yogurt for the buttermilk. The cake is not sweet enough (obviously my fault), but is also a bit bitter, like there was too much soda. Boo hoo.

Rating: 4
This cake turned out great. I followed the ingredients list exactly, but baked it as cupcakes. They were so moist and delicious. It will make about 18 cupcakes if you fill the cups about 3/4 of the way full. They are delicate and sweet and chocolate-y with a little hint of healthy from the zucchini. I like using zucchini in a recipe that uses chocolate instead of the standard zucchini bread recipes. Definitely a keeper. What a great way to use up summer zucchinis as fall begins!

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS. I made this more or less as written - the only things I did differently were to 1) "make" buttermilk out of milk and lemon juice since I had none on hand and 2) to squeeze out a little bit of the water from the zucchini (not bone dry or anything, just so that it wasn't dripping everywhere when I picked up handfuls of it). I baked 12 cupcakes from it (works beautifully - fill cups 2/3 full, sprinkle the chocolate chips and walnuts on like you would with the cake, took 25-30 minutes in my oven) and baked the rest in an 8"x8" pan. Best way I've found yet to use the small-child-sized zucchini that silently grow under the leaves in my vegetable garden until they're too big to hide anymore. (If you have one that big, though, be sure to scoop out the middle with the seeds first before grating.)

Rating: 3
Okay. So, this cake is good. (And I used only 1 cup sugar and also substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for the all purpose.) It is a very nice chocolate cake. But, I think that the Hershey's recipe for chocolate cake (with the cup of boiling water) is better and with only a 1/2 cup oil it is way better for you. I really like the idea of putting zucchini with chocolate, but shouldn't it be a little more healthy if you're already going to the trouble? I think so... I'll use this recipe as inspiration, but probably won't make it again.

Rating: 4
This is the only chocolate cake recipe I use. It's moist and has a great texture. I usually make it in a deep corningware, which results in about a 5 inch high cake. If you do it this way, you don't need a whole package of chocolate chips, and you of course need to bake longer. The other great thing about this cake is that it freezes marvellously!

Cake was really moist and tasted very,very good. Took much longer to cook than the directions said though. And next time I make this cake I would put a pecan or walnut crust at the bottom.

I'm not sure what went wrong with this cake. I found it actually very dry and crumbly. I added a little extra zucchini (about 1/2 cup) and decreased the sugar by about 1/4 but otherwise followed the recipe. I even baked it about 5 min less because I could tell it was done. None of those changes should have made it more dry, so I don't understand how everyone else had such a good result.

I made this yesterday and it is amazing! Even better this morning. I only used 1 1/2 cups sugar and also added 1 tsp cinnamon for a richer flavour. This cake is so dark and rich and moist, and I'm sure it will get even better in a few days, if there's any leet!

Yes, this is definitely a keeper. I substituted 1/4 cup whole week flour, and reduced the sugar by 1/4 cup. It was still very sweet and super moist. Baked in a bundt pan which added about 10 minutes to the bake time.

Best chocolate cake I've ever had. I made the following changes as I do with ALL my baking: I used whole grain spelt flour and I cut the sugar in half. I also used a little more zucchini, because I wanted to use it up, and cut the oil to 1/4 cup. It was dense, moist and delicious.

Excellent cake and it's still moist and fresh-tasting after three days in my fridge. I had to substitute Greek yogurt for the buttermilk (used slightly more because it's thicker)and did not use the walnuts due to allergies. It would also be delicious with the addition of some spices, such as cinnamon and cloves.

This cake was delicious! Super chocolatey and moist. I made it in a bundt pan and mixed dark chocolate chips and pecans into the batter. I use the spoonful of plain yogurt + 2% milk sub for buttermilk. It definitely disappeared quickly. I'm making it again today for a birthday so will add a chocolate glaze to the top this time around and will serve it with raspberry sorbet.

Made this cake today. Super delicious. My guests really enjoyed it! I was rushed and somehow blipped and did not sprinkle with chocolate chips and nuts even though they were sitting in front of me. I have to say I did not miss them. This is a lovely recipe. Try it. Very easy.

Hands down the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever tasted. I do not add the walnuts and I sometimes cut down on the number of chocolate chips but otherwise follow this recipe to the letter. It's outstanding. Super moist even a couple of days after baking and a great way to use up the zucchini. For extra moistness, I use a deep corningware container to bake it rather than a shallow pan. It comes out fluffy and rich - but be warned, it will take about an hour or even slightly more to bake at 350 if you pan is as deep as mine. So worth it.

Rating: 4
This was delicious, incredibly moist and not too sweet. Only change I made was the extra step of peeling my zucchini. I don't usually add nuts to my baked goods but I'm glad I didn't skip this ingredient, as the walnuts complimented the cake very well. I might reduce the sugar by a bit next time since 1 3/4 cup is a lot, but I think that's why the cake probably tasted so good. I'll definitely make this next time someone gives me a huge zucchini from their garden.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as it says and I am just blown away. You can't even taste the zucchini (flavour or texture). It's not overly sweet or chocolately - just a sublime, moist, fluffy chocolate cake; with vegetable! The crunchy walnuts gave the cake a wonderful texture to balance the supremely velvety cake. Make THIS recipe: you don't know what you're missing :)

SO GOOD, so chocolaty! Turned out wonderful for me. I didn't have buttermilk so I used soy milk with lemon juice as a substitute. I love the walnuts on top. Next time I will make with more walnuts and less chocolate chips on top, I think the cake is chocolaty enough without it.

Did anybody actually make THIS cake???? By the time you make all the substitutions and revisions, it's not the same cake.

Incidentally, the cake I made using THIS recipe, was fabulous.

I thought I would start by making the recipe exactly as written. It was basically a great chocolate cake with some zucchini thrown in for good measure. I didn't feel like the two were integrated well. but all in all the chocolate cake was good adn it was moist. I did make the high altitude adjustments.

What is with all these people that are doing applesauce etc. etc. substitutions...don't worry about a bit of butter once in a while. I used extra butter, extra chocolate chips, extra spices (cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, & nutmeg) mixed in, plus chocolate and pecans on top! The only reason it gets 3 forks is because the recipe doesn't call for very much zucchini.

Rating: 3
I've made this cake time and again as written during zucchini season -- it's a good way to use up zucchini that got waaaay toooo big, if you seed them before grating. As other reviewers have noted, this recipe works best if you squeeze the zucchini after grating on a box grater. The other night I made this for a picnic at work. I had some leftover chocolate buttercream frosting and a half a package of bittersweet chocolate chips from another cake I'd made, so I stirred the chips into the batter, left out the walnuts and frosted the cake. It was decadent and vanished within minutes. When people asked about the cake, they were shocked that it contained zucchini and loved the hidden chocolate chunks.

Rating: 2
Meh. Granted, I missed adding the vanilla, but my main complaints about this recipe are more about the texture, smell, and general feel of the cake. The taste is okay. The crumb is weird. And it seems that most of the people who LOVE this recipe made so many changes they didn't actually make this recipe. Won't make again - I believe there are better recipes out there.

Like everyone else, I subbed: yogurt+lemon juice for buttermilk, left out the butter, used only .5 c oil, yellow squash, not zukes, mabye 2.5 c My result was light and lovely, not and not particularly rich and chocolately. Next time I'm going to up the cocoa (and, maybe, invest in some higher quality stuff), and reduce the sugar.

My daughters claim this is the best chocolate cake ever. I don't know about that (chocolate mint layer cake ROCKS) but it IS very, very good. I used 1 T. orange extract in place of vanilla. Stirred 1 cup choc chips into batter, omitted nuts (don't care for them), and sprinkled additional 1/4 cup chips on top of cake. FABULOUS. OH! Here is the make-or-break tip: SQUEEZE the moisture out of the zucchini before you measure it!

Rating: 3
This is an interesting cake -- it has a light, fluffy texture and the zucchini is really not discernable (I pureed mine in a food processor and added it). The friends I offered it to couldn't tell that it had zucchini. I found that it was not very sweet ... but part of the problem was that I didn't have semi-sweet chips and put in bitter chocolate instead. I followed other reviews (thanks all) and mixed it into the batter, so the cake was lovely and chocolatey but I needed ice-cream with mine. I'll make it again with the semi-sweet chips.

Rating: 4
Adults without a huge sweet tooth loved this more sophisticated chocolate treat. Kids were turned off by the green evidence of zucchini; I'll peel next time for them. Made many of the substitutions/additions suggested by others: half whole wheat flour, half brown sugar, yogurt for buttermilk, orange zest and extract, some Vietnamese cinnamon. Forgot the nuts; next time will mix with chips directly into batter. Not sure if it still qualifies as the same recipe, but amazing as made. Baked 25 minutes in a 9" round pan and a 12-muffin tin. Muffins were perfect serving size.

This is the 4th time I made this recipe and changed a bit. I recommend to shift the flour twice. First after measuring it then shift with other dry ingredients again. Second, double the cooca powder. My husband loved it. This makes the cake very moist and light.

Excellent cake even when I forgot some steps. Didn't shift the flour, added dark chocolate chips, used salted butter, peeled zuchinni which turned out puree..hee., didn't use walnuts.. gosh that is a disaseater... However, the cake turns out yummy still... I'll definitely make it again given this was my very 1st time baking.

An excellent use for zucchini! I used less oil, and slightly more buttermilk and it was still excellently moist. Chocolate chips inside the cake are also delicious.

I've made this recipe numerous times over the past 17 years, it's been around for ages. I have never seen a cake call for 1 cup of fat, so after making it the first time, I just omitted the oil all together (just using 2 sticks of butter). You don't need to add the applesause, either, the zucchini will moisten the cake just fine. I add chocolate chips to the batter, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I prefer to use this for cupcakes, which can be transported to the kids' games, parties, etc. Frost with any chocolate frosting. As written I gave it 3 forks, as adjusted to my preferences I give it four.

great cake recipe.when i made it i used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil in place of the oil and butter called for. I also used full fat yogurt instead of buttermilk because that is what i had. i have used regular milk also and it works fine. also, i stir the nuts and chocolate chips in instead of sprinkling on top. i have also used 1/2 whole wheat flour in the past. i find sifting the flour, cocoa powder and baking soda prior to adding makes it better than if you dont sift.

This was very good. I made it as directed, except I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk because that's what I had on hand. Also, I mixed in the walnuts and chocolate chips instead of putting them on top.

It took way longer to bake than it said (probably an extra 20 minutes or so). Highly recommended!

Yum. Do not delude yourself into believing that the presence of zucchini turns this into a healthy recipe. This cake is rich and chocolatey with a moist, dense crumb-- and nearly two cups of sugar! I poured the batter into a loaf pan and turned the excess into mini muffins. The result was a bit crumbly but delish!

Very good and easy to make. I used applesauce in place of oil and added some grated chocolate (64%) to the batter. I did not put the chips and nuts on top as I intend to ice half the cake. The un-iced portions we've had with ice cream and for breakfast are quite nice, not too sweet, not very rich though - the ganache topping I'll add will bump up the decadence!

This is my second review of the cake I baked on Thursday, December 13th. When I tried this on Friday morning, after baking on Thursday evening and cooling overnight, I wasn't pleased with the cake. However, by Saturday, the flavors of the cake had melded and were absolutely wonderful! I had forgotten to mention that I didn't have buttermilk and substituted regular milk, which I'm sure affected the texture of the cake. I didn't know the importance of the acid in the buttermilk at the time, but a little research was very helpful. [Buttermilk substitutions: 1 tbsp. lemon juice or vinegar + enough whole milk to make 1 cup - let stand for 5 minutes OR 1 3/4 tsp. cream of tartar + plus 1 cup whole milk OR 1 cup plain yogurt.]Next time I make this I will be sure to use the nuts. The orange flavoring I used (zest of 1 whole orange & 3 tsp. orange extract) worked better than I had thought, I would like to try adding 2 tbsp. Leroux Triple Sec, but probably won't experiment with the orange marmalade substitution for oil as I think it would be overpowering. I used butter instead of oil and I enjoyed the richness it provided. So, do try to make this a couple of days in advance if possible, it is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever eaten and I am not partial to chocolate cake! I think that the richness of the cake requires that it be cut into much smaller than 12 servings, I think 16 or 24 would be much more appropriate.

Rating: 2
My husband enjoyed the cake, but I thought that it was too chocolatey. I should have made this as written, but instead followed the suggestion to increase the cocoa to 3/4 cup and reduced the flour by the same amount. Do that only if you like a VERY chocolatey product. Even after squeezing the excess water from the zucchini, the texture of the cake was much like that of a fudgey brownie. Even after cooling overnight, I found the cake difficult to cut, don't know why. Omitted the walnuts because of a concern about nut allergies and wished that I hadn't. I added 3 teaspoons of orange extract and the freshly grated zest of one whole orange which gave it a very pleasant undertone. I couldn't find any Grand Marnier at the supermarket, may try that the next time I make this. Also, will try substituting orange marmalade/orange juice mixture for the oil. I substituted more butter for the vegetable oil as the only vegetable oil I had on hand was extra-virgin olive oil. I don't use corn oil or corn syrup in baked goods. I thought that the suggestion to use cocoa powder to "flour" the baking dish was particularly helpful. I used the recommended size pan in pyrex instead of metal and my oven maintained the required temperature per my oven thermometer. Any suggestions for improving my approach would be appreciated.

Delicious and very moist! You cannot hardly see the zucchini unless you really look for it. I used half whole-wheat pastry flour, reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, subbed applesauce for the oil, and omitted the nuts.

Our guests liked it that they even took some home with them -- aving us from eating the whole pan by ourselves.

This is a "died and gone to heaven" cake! I made standard sized cupcakes and large cupcakes. I liked the large cupcakes better. I made no adjustments for high altitude.

This cake was very, very rich. I substituted unsweetened applesauce for the vegetable oil, which worked well, and didn't use the walnuts as I didn't have any.

This is our favorite way to use our huge summer zucchini. I brought this in to work the other day, and lots of people requested the recipe. We like to bake it in loaf pans and save it for the winter. When we plan on freezing it, we put the chocolate chips inside, rather than on top of the loaves.

I reduced sugar to 1 cup and mixed lots of crushed walnuts in the batter. These baked well as mini muffins. For loaves I used parchment paper in the pans, otherwise they sticked.

This was such a great way to use up the zucchini in our garden. I made this into oversized muffins instead of a cake. Delicious!! Very moist and chocolaty. I used a bit less sugar than what the recipe called for and was out of buttermilk so I used some coconut milk I had on hand. Also used 1/2 the amount of chocolate chips. I stuck some of the muffins in the freezer and we've been munching on them for 2 weeks!

I love making sweet and savory zucchini breads and this is the best one by far. Of course anything with Ghiradelli 60% dark chocolate chips is going to be good.

This cake was a hit for my daughter's 2nd birthday party. I wanted to make something that had at least some healthy qualities (zucchini). I made one cake with the nuts and left it unfrosted, and the other I made nut-free and frosted with chocolate fudge frosting. The latter was the hit! I wish the cake were just a tad less dry, though. However, it tasted very homemade.

Fabulous recipe! Very chocolatey - I didn't find it bland at all! Super easy to make. The only change I made was to spread chocolate frosting on top which I highly recommend. My kids loved it too!

I made this cake exactly as described in the recipe - no changes or substitutions - and found it to be very bland and one-dimensional. It was moist and chocolate-y, but somehow that didn't redeem it for us. I've never been keen on brownies made with cocoa powder - they seem to have a flat, rather flavourless taste to me - so perhaps that was the problem with this cake. It certainly was easy to make and cooked in the time specified, but the end result was unexciting and not even worth that much effort.

Stellar! This cake is moist, not too sweet, and very chocolaty. The adjustments I made were suggested by others here and worked very well. I used applesauce instead of the butter and it didn't seem to make any difference as to the texture or flavor of the dish, so next time I may use it for both the butter and oil. I subbed in plain yogurt for the buttermilk, which also worked very well. I mixed half the nuts and chips into the batter, and the rest on top, which produced a really well-integrated texture and flavor for the cake. Also, as others have done, I dusted the pan with cocoa instead of flour -- a great idea. I will absolutely add this cake to my rotation (and I'm really more of a cook than a baker, so that's a big deal). My fiance loved it, as did I -- it's so easy, it seems like the perfect impressive dish to bring to a party or serve to guests.

WONDERFUL !!! I made this for an office party, and everybody loved it!! I left out the walnuts, (I don't like them) and I put the chocolate chips in the batter, not on top of the cake. It filled two round cake pans nicely. Next time, I'm going to bake the batter in muffin tins... it would be perfect.

Moist, tender cake, not too sweet, but a nice cocoa flavour. My partner hates zucchini but had no problem with this cake. I did replace the walnuts with pecans, and did peel the zucchini.

This was excellent! I have never made anything with zucchini before, but I had a zucchini and was looking for something fun to try for a dinner party. I made this and it got rave reviews! I will definitely make it again! Thanks

I love this cake, and everyone I serve it to is stunned that it is a zucchini-based cake. Best results come from using a high quality cocoa powder. I use my food processer to shred my zuke, and did not have to squeeze any extra liquid out. Cake is moist, tender, and flavorful.

This cake was moist, rich, chocolatey & light, not overly sweet; a hit all around, as good for breakfast as for dessert. You really have to squeeze the shreds out, but a good use of those giant zucchinis that are being given away everywhere! Loved it.

This past weekend I made this cake in the 9x13 as well as the bundt pan and both turned out very nicely! I added about 7 mins to the baking time for the bundt version. Everyone who tried it loved it. It is sooo moist and perfect if you need a chocolate fix :) I substituted 1/2 the oil for some applesauce like one of the other reviewers suggested and I think next time I will use all applesauce.

Haven't made this yet (though intend to on Saturday) but just because it has zucchini, doesn't mean it's 'healthful' ... with 12 servings, it clocks in at nearly 500 calories and 12 Weight Watchers points ... do make it but with eyes open! AK

This cake is AMAZING, moist and delicious. Even people who don't like zucchini will love this cake. I used one zucchini and one summer squash since that is what I had.

Very good cake, light texture, chocolaty without being too sweet. Next time I'll add walnuts to the batter as well as on top. Used mini chips as that's what I had on hand.

Rating: 4
This is a cake beyond compare. I added a tsp. of chocolate extract in addition to the vanilla. Also subbed sour cream for the buttermilk. Two cups of grated zucchini weighed 12-1/2 oz. before squeezing out the excess liquid. (I hate it when a recipe says to use 1 medium or large whatever--what is that? Give me a weight!!!) I put 1/2 of the nuts in the batter, and the other 1/2 on top, along with the chocolate chips. Since we live at about 4500 feet in elevation, I added 1 extra Tbs. of flour to the dry mixture, and increased the oven temp. to 350 degrees. Do try this. WONDERFUL, and you don't have to make a frosting!!!

Rating: 4
I wanted to try this recipe instead of the same one that I always use. I asked my son if he was interested in making this last night while I was preparing dinner. The only thing he didn't add was the nuts, because another family member doesn't like them. It is excellent and has a rich dark chocolate flavor.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly for this cake. I squeezed all the moisture out of the zucchini. It is not too sweet. Needs no icing. Next time I will add some pecans. Looks very nice made in a bundt pan and sprinkled with icing sugar just before serving. Definetly a keeper.

Rating: 4
Made it for the first time last week for a last-minute potluck and had no butter milk or cocoa (used regular milk and semi-sweet chocolate). Anyhow, the essential is that even without these ingredients, the cake turned out wonderfully and two people asked me for the recipe. Very moist and delicious.

Rating: 3
This cake was delicious. I served it warm as my guests were short on time, and it melted in our mouths. No frosting needed - it was both rich and light (at least while warm). To the cook in Munich - excess moisture makes the cake heavier, not lighter. Be sure to squeeze moisture out of zucchini.

I did not have buttermilk, so I used sour cream with same results. I also used a bundt cake pan because it looks prettier. Everyone loved it.

Another excellent recipe to add to my growing collection from this site. The cake was very rich, moist and good. I used a gourmet cocoa and added a teaspoon of Chocolate Extract too. Both purchased from King Author Flour. There is a link from Epicurious...

This has quickly become my standard chocolate cake recipe... it is so moist and delicious! I have a good story about how I came to seek out this recipe. Last summer, I had a potted garden on my deck and too my surprise a zucchini grew by accident- it ended up taking over a whole pot (not intended) and I watched it get bigger and bigger and knew that by the time it was ready for picking, I simply couldn't let it go the way of a simple stir-fry... so after looking around on this site, I stumbled upon this recipe. Now I wont make a chocolate cake without a zucchini in it ever again!

I was at a cafe and had a choc zucchini cake that was light & delicious so when I came home, I looked for one to bake on my own. Although the one at the cafe was much better, this was also very good - heavier and more like a moist brownie. I mixed the nuts in but left the chips on top. Chips don't seem necessary but nice touch. I didn't squeeze out the zucchini as I thought this would make it more light. Also used mostly wholewheat flour as I ran out of plain flour.

Rating: 4
This is the recipe my friend at work is famous for. Think chocolate version of carrot cake. Very chocolaty but not too sweet. Be sure to squeeze out all of the water in the zucchini. We also mix the chips and nuts into the cake, bake it in layers, then use a chocolate cream cheese icing. Refrigerate overnight before serving. Like other reviewers, we think it's better after the flavors have a day or 2 to develop. This is a very dense cake, so it will serve a large crowd.

I unfortunately made this instead of the chocolate chip zucchini cake.....I did not like this cake at all

This recipe was not only terrifically delicious, but also terrifically easy to make! I used even a little more than 2 cups of zucchini, and the cake came out so wonderfully moist & tender that everyone who tried it wanted the recipe. I also used a combination of milk & semi-sweet chips on the top, with the walnuts & a little bit of shredded coconut... YUM!

Rating: 1
Ewww! I am not sure what I did wrong, but I followed all instructions, only thing I left out were the nuts (didn't have any). The result was not very good. I think the 2 cups zucchini was a lot for this cake. This was a waste of my chocolate chips!

I tried this recipe last weekend after running out of ideas for using zucchini (my zucchini plants went nuts) and everyone loved it! My husband like it so much, and he is not a dessert person, that he asked that I make it for a get together we are going to this weekend. What I like about it, besides it being very easy to make, is that it is not too sweet and very moist. I also did not think it was heavy. I think its a perfect blend of chocolate flavor, sweetness and moisture content. This recipe is a definite keeper. I have already given it out to 5 people.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the suggestion of another cook and dusted baking pan with cocoa powder. I grated a thick piece of chocolate instead of chips over cake and squeezed excess moisture out of zucchini. A winner!

Great Cake! I made it in 2 layers and used a cream cheese frosting between layers and on top. Also used pecans instead of walnuts and sprinkled then on top of the frosting too. Great presentation but made it more sweet and richer. The cake was great on it's own. Didn't need the frosting

Rating: 3
I enjoyed this cake very much. I did think it was a bit on the heavy side. So the next time I make it I'm going to make sure I drain all the juice from the zucchini and I may try adding an extra egg. To help it to be lighter. Please don't be afraid to try this one it's good!

Yum... this came out great... I got tons of compliments on this one. You wouldn't even know there's zucchini in the cake. Next time I think I might put the nuts/chips IN the batter and bake it in a bundt pan. I will definitely make this again!

I loved this recipe, a great way to use up zucchini at the end of the season! Following the other chefs reviews, I added half of the walnuts and chocolate chips to the batter, spreading the rest on top. I also tried adding some unsweetened, shredded, dried coconut to the batter to give it some texture and it turned out fabulous! Have gotten raves over it. More of a brownie type thing than a cake.

I made this recipe for a zucchini lover's birthday cake. While it was yummy and easy, we couldn't really taste the zucchini. Also, it should definitely go with a little vanilla ice cream and I didn't think of getting any (The zucchini set me off). This is more like a chocolate bread/cake- not quite as sweet as cake. I'd say the only benefit of it being a zucchini cake is perhaps to hide vegetables from your kids in a dessert.

I substitute 3/4 of the butter for apple sauce, for health reasons. Tastes just as good either way. Each time I have made it - everyone wants the recipe. VR

This cake is so moist! The zucchini part doesn't sound that great, but it is delicious. I think I only put in about 1½ c. of zucchini, but I grated it pretty fine. I added about 2 T. more flour since I'm at high altitude. I also didn't quite add ½ of oil. I'm not a huge icing fan, so topping this cake off with walnuts and choc. chips is perfection!

I have never heard of mixing chocolate and zucchini before, and at first glance I couldn't imagine how it could taste good. But I was pleasantly surprised - this was delicious! My husband and I don't like zucchini very much, except for zucchini bread, and I never know what to do with all of the zucchini our neighbors give us from their garden. Now I know.

I'm a die hard Chocolate-Zucchini fan but my version is of the bread variety. It's similar but omits some of the fat (no butter, etc). I tried to make it into muffins once -- to drier-than-Woody Allen- result. My question is: does more fat make this recipe more muffin-y? (No matter the answer: Do try the recipe; choc-chini anything is brilliant -- even eighteen year old boys love it)

This was great--moist and delicious. It would be a great way to sneak some veggies into the diet of non-veggie-lovers--the zucchini is barely visible. The chocolate chips on top might not even be necessary--the cake is plenty chocolate-y as is.

Every time I take this to my office or my husband takes it to his, it gets rave reviews. As my zucchini comes out of the garden (and we can't consume all of it at once), I immediately grate it and freeze it in two-cup increments. Then I make this all winter long.

FABULOUS cake, and it probably won't single-handedly kill you with calories and fat. I made it the night before, one of my layers broke so I ate some right out of the oven. Wasn't too pleased BUT the next day, after the flavors had the chance to meld, it was rich, intensely chocolaty and not cloyingly sweet with a texture closer to a dense mousse than a cakey cake. The frosting is delish too.

i substituted 2 cups whole wheat flour and a 1/4 cup of wheat germ and mixed the chocolate chips in with the batter and it tasted fantastic. the texture was a little soft...but it could be because i baked it in a bundt pan...maybe next time a shallow pan will be better. it does taste like a brownie and it's delicious.

This cake is easy to make and delicious! I took the suggestions of other bakers and mixed the chocolate chips in the batter - had to leave out the nuts due to allergies. Dusted the top with icing sugar. Next time I will try it with the nuts and chips on top! I couldn't taste the zucchini and did not even see pieces of it in the cake - I used the finest side of the grater so the pieces of zucchini were very small. Everyone liked the cake!

My family loves this recipe, straight. The top is creamy with the chocolate and crisp with the nuts and the way the top naturally cooks, so no need for a frosting at all. I always love having it for breakfast the next day. What's better yet is that it works wonderfully at high altitude just the way it's written. That's fairly rare, but the zucchini seems to keep the moisture really well.

I'm giving this a 4 because it is delicious as written and holds up to change beautifully, too. To make it healthier, I subbed the applesauce for the butter, used 3/4 C. whole wheat pastry flour, 1-1/4 C. white, & 1/4 C. oat & wheat bran. I mixed in 3/4 C of chips and 1/2 C.toasted walnuts and 3/4 -1 C. chopped prunes. My kids still loved it! Thanks everyone.

Try this out for a different version of the Chocolate Zucchini Cake. Leave out the cocoa powder in the batter, but put the chocoalte chips in. This tastes just like the Blonde Brownies my mother made when I was a child.Either way this cake is truly excellent!

On Sunday, I was feeling very down so for a treat, I made seafood risotto (also from this site) and this cake for desert. Well, this dinner sure made me feel better! Used applesauce instead of butter as suggested by other reviewers, and served the desert (to myself) with vanilla frozen yoghurt. It was so yummy I had seconds! It's 2 days later now, and the cake is still moist and delicious. Oh, I put half the chocolate chips & walnuts in the batter, and the other half on top as a compromise :)

I didn't have choc chips (don't have them here) so I added grated orange peel and I pureed the zucchini. The batter was soupy but I baked it in the bundt pan and it was delicious.

More like a brownie than a cake. Used previous comments to adapt recipe-mixed in most of the nuts and chips but sprinkled some on top. The walnuts on top looked nice. Also used all of the oil called for, but substituted applesauce for the butter with excellent results. Will definetely make again.
