This bread turned out fantastic - excellent texture and nice crunch with the fresh corn. Perhaps those who ended up with pudding had cooked the corn kernels first? I omitted the sugar and added some chili peppers for a more savoury loaf - great with cheese and a bruschetta topping!

Delicious cornbread. Moist and tender with great fresh corn taste. Omitted basil. Baked nicely flat and cut cleanly without crumbiling. One of the best cornbreads I have ever tasted. Mich. cook

More like corn pudding...and I even omitted the sugar, which anyone who knows cornbread would never add to this good, savory bread made to accompany a meal. Anything called cornbread would never be made with sugar.

waste of thyme..no pun intended.flavourless and white pudding!

This was a moist cornbread that reheated well. I will likely make it again, but would skip the basil (hardly noticeable) and possibly increase the salt a bit. Chopped roasted jalapenos might be mixed in.

this was excellent! I did, however, omit the basil from this recipe and it still came out fabulous! try it!

I used frozen corn on the cob and pesto instead of fresh basil. I also cut down on the sugar (to about 2 tablespoons), since I'm not too fond of overly sweet cornbread. The consistency was great and the pesto added a nice punch.

I thought this was the best cornbread recipe! Loved the use of fresh corn and basil. Anyone who didn't like it must have made it incorrectly.

My family really likes this cornbread recipe - we think it's much better than the Joy-of-Cooking version my mom has been making for years. We do cut down on the sugar, as we prefer a more savory cornbread, and we used fresh grilled corn and home-grown basil. It's a great flavor combination. I had some for breakfast this morning. An interesting variation would be to substitute green chiles for the basil.

I didn't put in the basil, but it had no flavor and was really dry. I only cooked it for about 35 minutes, but it was really dry and tasteless. Maybe the basil would have helped the flavor, but it still would have sucked.

I agree with the reviewer from Calgary: the basil just doesn't work here, but when I made it again and left the basil out, we thought it was outstanding. Used just-picked sweet corn from the farmers market, which with 1/2 c sugar, did make it very sweet, as the previous reviewer noted. I might cut it back to 1/3 c. going forward but otherwise thought the core recipe was fabulous: great texture, crumb, moistness, and wonderful flavor from the fresh corn. Will absolutely make again.

This was only fair - unlike the previous reviewer, I thought this was a bit too sweet - and the combination of sweet with basil was rather odd. I made it in a 9 x 9 pan as suggested, but I think now I prefer cornbreads baked in a cast iron skillet - they have a much nicer crust.

hated this - terrible taste - not sweet enough - waste of time

Pretty good. It was moist enough, but rather bland. Next time I'd add more basil or go the Southwest route as suggested and substitute jalapeno peppers and/or green chiles.

This was wonderful and so moist. I made it for a potluck and it disappeared very quickly. I saw several people go back for seconds. The only change I made was to omit the basil and add 2 seeded, minced jalapeno peppers. I will be making this again for sure!!!

The corn is fresh off the cob. If it was cooked it would have said so.

Great cornbread. I never thought of using fresh basil. I used corn flour instead of white flour and the corn was uncooked, cut off the cob. The sugar makes it sweet. My guests loved it, even the kids!

First off, no, the corn is not already cooked. Just cut off the raw cob and use it. Second, this was on the good side of okay. I made it into muffins (I was in a hurry) and cooked for 16 minutes. It yielded about 20 muffins. (!) Personally, I thought the dough was a little dry and the basil a little weird. But it was better than some other cornbread recipes I've tried.

Question: Is the corn already cooked?

The cornbread was fabulous! My son, who has a very narrow range of foods he likes was skeptical, but endorsed it wholeheartedly. I served it warm as a previous reviewer suggested. I really stuffed the basil into the measuring cup - but next time will put in less. It overpowered the fresh corn taste somewhat. This recipe is a great find and will become a summer standard.

Delicious! Made exactly as recipe stated. I served it at room temp. first and it was very good. Later, I heated some before serving and it was wonderful. My advice is to serve it warm!

This cornbread is amazing! The fresh corn makes it so moist and flavorful. I made two batches: one as listed here, and another replacing the basil with 2 chopped jalepeno peppers. The jalepeno version was even better! See a photo of the end result at http://www.dawnsrecipes.com/jalepeno-cornbread-150.htm

I thought this recipe was wonderful. It was a great way to use all of that basil growing in my garden and take advantage of that fresh corn. It's a bit time consuming for a weeknight meal, but perfect for the weekend. My husband loved it too!

being a critical corn-bread lover, I think this is a wonderful, moist recipe. You could even add a little more fresh basil for more flavor- but a great "summery" version to go with barbecues.
