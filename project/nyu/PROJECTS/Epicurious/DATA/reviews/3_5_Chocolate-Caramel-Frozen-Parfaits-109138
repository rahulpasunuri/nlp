I'm cheating a bit because I also reviewed this recipe back in 2004 (see below), but want to offer a new suggestion! I love this recipe and it's always my go-to for dinner parties. Can be made days before, stuck in the freezer and requires no prep on the night of the party. This time I didn't have paper/plastic cups so I made it in glasses. To serve, I added whipped cream and berries on top and served it in the glass as a traditional parfait. Yum!

WAY too much work for end result. I spent over an hour and a half in preparation for an "ok" end result. None of my guests finished the dessert...proportions too much ( I even cut it back based on comments from other reviews. Will not repeat this one

I made these parfaits for a formal party I had back in June. Everyone loved them, and they were mouth watering good. The preparation takes a long time, and they invade the space of the entire freezer. Boy, was it a fun experiment between my partner and I. Give them a try when you have a night dedicated to yumminess.

This was very good but needed a lot of pans to prepare it. It definitely could be made smaller. I wonder if making it in muffin pans, filled halfway would work?

This is just a lovely rich chocolate indulgence. Pretty simple to make, worth all the effort, and you can make it way ahead. This is the recipe I fall back on when I can't find anything new that I feel like making. Yummmmmmmmm!!!

This was a FABULOUS dessert. My guests raved about it. I served the parfaits on a bed of whipped cream (as previously suggested), swirled the hot chocolate sauce around and on the parfait, and added the raspberries as garnish. (The only downside was a counter full of dirty dishes after making the parfaits.)

I made this for friends last night and everyone loved it. I agree with other reviewers that the caramel taste is very sublte, but it did lighten the chocolate. I served it with some caramel sauce left over from the flourless cake recipe that everyone loves and the hot fudge, which was extremely good. Also, I used smaller cups (plastic, which ended up being easier that paper would have been) than the recipe called for and can't imagine anyone eating more than a couple of ounces. It's very rich.

I made this for dessert for a dinner party. Everyone thought that it was really great. It was Very rich, though. I served it on a bed of whipped cream. That helped with the richness.

definately a "keeper" recipe... the texture was amazing... the caramel taste is very subtle, the caramel seems to mostly enhance the texture (creamy and delicious) I skipped the hot fudge sauce and served it with hot caramel sauce instead...OUTSTANDING!

This dessert received fantastic reviews from my guests. I definitely recommend using small cups, 4-5 oz. Even for a chocolate lover like myself, it's an incredibly rich dessert and difficult to eat the recommended serving size. I'm curious if anyone can come up with a better way to bring out the caramel flavor as I had the same problem as the other reviewers. I'm wondering if perhaps you set aside the caramel mixture and poured it in separately at the end, that would bring out more of the flavor? If not... it's a great dessert anyway and really easy to prepare in advance for a dinner party.

I agree with the last viewer. I found the carmel concoction after it was whipped awesome, I added the chocolate to it and lost alllll caramel taste. I did not even have a hint of it .

I thought this recipe was a pain in the neck. I spent all this time making the carmel, then added the chocolate and totally lost the caramel taste.I mean not a smidge of caramel. I only had 4 8 oz cups which turned out to be a blessing because I didn't like the texture and was disappointed in the taste.

Excellent recipe! The texture is so smooth: very sophisticated. We served this as part of a dessert sampler for an extended family Valentine's dinner. I used 5 oz.cups instead of the suggested 8-9oz. and recipe yielded 9 portions. I think that the volume of the last cup of whipped cream is critical to for the overall yield. I used ultra-pasturized cream, which is notoriously slow to bring to stiff peaks (I got that piece of info from Cook's Illus.) BTW, I agree that the caramel taste was subtle, but do I think that if it was stronger, the parfait would have tasted more like toffee (a little too sweet for my taste). For anyone interested, the desert sampler we made consisted of the parfait, a 1/2-inch thin slice of Chocolate hazelnut tart with two sauces: low-fat vanilla custard and raspberry coulis. All the recipes except the berry coulis came from epicurious, and they were easy to prepare the day before. I also have to write about the beautiful dessert presentation my wonderful sister-in-law created. On each dessert plate, she spooned 2T of the vanilla custard off-center, set the parfait into the center of the pool, and then placed the tart slice diagonnally. She then put a dab of the custard on the top of the parfait, added a drop of the coulis and shaped it like a heart. She added more hearts to the vanilla sauce pool, pooled more coulis on the opposite side of the tart (away from the parfait), and added a reverse heart in custard. Three fresh raspberries on the tart, and more raspberries and candied hazelnuts around the perimeter of the plate. Divine! Feel free to E-mail me for the entire menu (I have it in a word doc.)

These are delicious! The texture is similar to ice-cream, but these are much richer. While they are mostly chocolate, they are not overwhelmingly so. I made them for Valentine's Day, along with a white cake with white chocolate ganache and raspberry coulis. Everyone preferred the parfaits! Next time I am going to try to layer the caramel and the chocolate, so that there might be a stronger caramel taste. Also, I did not get 8 servings, I had only six servings in a 9 oz. cup, filled 3/4 full.

These were delicious, but I agree - the caramel taste wasn't strong at all. Plus, did anyone else have a problem getting 8 servings? I made them twice and still only had 6 servings each time(using 8oz paper cups - filled up to about 1" from top).
