This is a fantastic recipe. The key is to use small artichokes and cook them until they are very soft. An excellent recipe for entertaining.

I understand if the taste was bad, but you only have yourself to blame for using large artichokes. You can't cook them in the same way as the baby ones. Next time do your homework.

I tried this as a test before a dinner party. Thank goodness! It's by no means horrible, but it's not worth the effort. I used lovely baby artichokes, but the flavor was drowned out by the lemon! There was almost not artichoke flavor at all. The hearts were good, but some of the leaves were still a bit tough to chew. There was no way I was going to serve this to guests.

I LOVE epicurious! This is the only website I use. But this particular recipe is AWFUL! I couldn't even serve it - threw it in the garbage. No baby artichokes to be found so used regular. Even after hacking away 80% of the artichoke, the outer leaves were tough to chew. No taste at all except for lemon. Very bland and tough to boot!
