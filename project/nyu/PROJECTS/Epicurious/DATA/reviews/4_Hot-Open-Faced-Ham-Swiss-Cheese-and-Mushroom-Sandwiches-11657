Very good and simple enough for a weeknight meal. I have made this with carmelized onions and grilled onions. Portobellas on the grill are amazing on this as well.

I too changed the original recipe. It came out great. Lots of ways to mix this recipe up. I didn't have dill so I used basil instead.

it might not be fair to rate this recipe as i used it for inspiration to create another...Used Sourdough instear of Rye. Grilled the onions. Cooked whole muchroom caps in butter & Garlic. Used 3 different cheese. Swiss, Havarti and Jarlsberg. They were fantastic

Heavenly, and I am not even the biggest "ham and swiss" fan. Love the dill in the mayo. Works wonderfly on the broiler. A quick and easy light dinner or lunch.

This is a delicious sandwich. I used baby portabella mushrooms and made it as a grilled sandwich in my pannni maker. YUM. The dill sauce makes it special and unique.

I added this recipe to our lunch menu at our Bistro. I do use a FRESH baked bread roll, toasted. I offered this to our restaurant patrons, for a free sample. We have customers, who are refusing to eat this sandwich for free as it is SOO good, that they insist... on paying for it! Additionally, we havd a 99 year old patron eat this, and ask if we would cater his 100 year old birthday, as this was the best ham & cheese sandwich he ever had in his life. I think that...says it all. It's a no Lose proposition to make this sandwich. IMO Dee Nusser/Executive Chef/Brother's Bistgro/San Diego/California

A terrific sandwich. When dinner is going to be light or late, I just double the recipe and we have no trouble finishing them up. They're easy to make and delicious--a great combination.

I make this frequently. It's easy and very good. I, too, add a thin slice of tomato. Sometimes use mushrooms, sometimes not.

I made this for my husband and he really liked it a lot. He doesn't like mushrooms, so I substituted them with a slice of tomato. Nice chance of pace from a typical ham and cheese sandwich, will make again. The mustard mayo dill taste really came through.
