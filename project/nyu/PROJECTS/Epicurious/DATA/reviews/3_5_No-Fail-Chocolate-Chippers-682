I was really disappointed with how dry these cookies turned out. I found them bland and in need of all the things that make a chocolate chip cookie great such as flavor and moisture.

Love this recipe! It's now our go-to chocolate chip cookie recipe. My changes: used spelt flour and couldn't tell a difference. Used a little less white sugar and tried pecans instead. Yum!

Dry as a bone when made according to directions. Fail.

These cookies have great eye and taste appeal. They look beautiful and also have the added nutrional value of oatmeal. For a variation, substitute the chocolate chips with 1 cup raisins and coarsely chopped walnuts. These cookies are part of my cookie jar rotation.

basic, oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. One recipe makes 3.5 dozen, (not 2 dozen)

I love these cookies, and they never last for more than two days in my home. Easy to make!

Have been making these cookies for years now, always to rave reviews. Very easy to make, extremely tasty, and never have to worry about storing them for too long. I personally like them a bit chewier, and tend to cook for 11 minutes instead of the directed 12. If you're looking for a very tasty, very chewy cookie, this would be a good recipe. If you're more interested in the more brittle chocolate chip frisbees, this probably isn't for you.

These were really good cookies! The oatmeal gives a slightly chewy texture and I think it helped keep them from spreading too thin (always a problem for me with chocolate chip cookie recipes). A definite make-again!

I followed this recipe to the letter, I was not impressed. I'd stick to a basic chocolate chip cookie recipe over this one.

This is a great chocolate chip cookie! I used bittersweet chocolate chips instead of milk chocolate and they are wonderful. Will make this again and again.

These are fabulous. My food processor isn't large so I simply mixed the ground oats together with the other dry ingredients in another bowl. I also used pecans vs walnuts. Try these.

BE WARNED. These cookies can be extremely addictive! I made 2 batches in 2 weeks because I was dreaming of them. A skinny friend stopped herself at 2 and a not-so-skinny friend stopped at 3. I won't tell how many I stop at in private. I have stopped looking for chocolate chip cookie recipes. THIS IS IT for me!

I made to sell at the refreshment booth during intermission at my school's play. One woman bought two, and then came back and bought six to bring home with her. One of the better chocolate chip cookie recipes out there.

Delicious cookies. The oatmeal gives them a very nice texture.

I was searching for a new chocolate chip cookie recipe and came across this one. My 14 year old daughter loves these and makes them all the time. They are a hit no matter where we take them and who eats them. We also subsitute semi-sweet chocolate for the milk chocolate.

Excellent. They also have a great texture, appearance-wise and taste-wise. The only thing I would change next time is doubling the vanilla.

These are wonderful cookies. They look awesome and the taste is the same. Will make these again.

I will never make another chocolate chip cookie other than this one! Others always went flat. My Husband said these are the best cookie I've ever made! That's all the proof I need!

Delicious! Also very easy to make.

Everyone that eats these cookies absolutely loves them! I make them every time we have a neighborhood gathering and everyone asks for them again and again. I sometimes mix semi sweet chips in with the milk chocolate and they are very good.

What can I say? These cookies are fantastic!! They are great-tasting and beautiful looking. They're not greasy or overly sweet like most chocolate chip cookies, and their texture is absolute perfection - crunchy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. My husband, who basically doesn't like chocolate chip cookies, couldn't stop eating these! I did only two things differently - I used half the amount of chocolate chips and I used semi-sweet instead of milk chocolate. Next time I'm going to follow the recommendation of the Cook from Philadelphia, PA on 10/10/99, to use quick oats and skip the processing. (After I lose the weight I just put on from eating too many of these)!!!

This has become my signature chocolate chip cookie recipe. I subsitute some peanut butter for the butter to make some superior peanut butter chocolate chip cookies. YUM!

I've been making these cookies since the BA issue first came out. I have received nothing but raves over the years and everyone requests that I bring in a batch over the holidays. I agree with a previous reviewer that, for whatever reason, these cookies just taste better than the average chocolate chipper. Of course, this may be due in part to the fact that I substitute Hersey's Symphony milk chocolate bars for the chocolate chips (I've used all kinds: regular, almond toffee, cookies and cream). I recommend two 7 oz bars. Occasionally, I will also substitute pecans for the walnuts. The pecans and creamy milk chocolate go wonderfully together.

I have made these cookies many times and everyone loves them. I use about 3/4 of an 11.5 ounce bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips (not a fan of milk chocolate). I think there's less butter in this recipe than in most other chocolate chip cookie recipes I've seen and I like the resulting consistency. Not greasy but not dry either. I'll never bother with another chocolate chip recipe for the rest of my life. This is it!

These cookies are absolutely delicious, better than the 'average' chocolate chip cookie. People love them and can't really say why they taste better than the average cookie. I'm sure it's the processed oats.

I followed all the instructions to the letter when making these cookies. However, I think these should be renamed 'slice', not 'cookies' or 'biscuits'. The texture, although delicious, was extremely moist (almost soggy) due to all the chocolate chips. It's not really what was expected but it's worth a try.

I have made this recipe dozens of times and have always gotten rave reviews. After a lot of experimenting, I suggesting using quick oats instead of old-fashioned and skip the processing.

These cookies are always tender and moist, they get chewy if they last. The oatmeal gives a nice flavor, too.
