I've never given a recipe one fork. I tried this before making it for a cocktail party and ended up throwing it away. I love fennel, kalamatas, & cream cheese and this recipe is just plain yucky. It was a horrible pink purple color for the stuffing and unbelievably flavorless and a really creepy combo of creamy and crunchy...ick.
