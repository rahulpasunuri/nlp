This is my new chocolate cake recipe! I halved this recipe and it was more than enough for two 9-inch pans. The only thing I changed was substituting some of the white flour for whole wheat, which is something I do with anything I bake. I'm sure it would have been lovely either way. I am also not a huge fan of frosting so I left that out and grated dark chocolate on the top of the cakes while they were still warm.

This is indeed the best chocolate cake around. Years ago, I baked professionally, which has made me pretty picky, but I made this recipe for about 18 people last weekend and everyone agreed it was the best. A few notes: 1) It should be made in three 9 inch cake pans, NOT 8 inch. The batter fit perfectly with that change. 2)The better the chocolate, the better the cake. 3) When the cake is cool, cut the tops off to level the cake and you'll have a beautiful but enormous cake. You'll get a good 20 slices out of this cake, more than the recipe suggests. 4) Finally, I found that, with the 9" cake pans, the amount of frosting was light, so I filled the 2 middle layers with freshly whipped cream and just put a thick layer of the icing on the top and sides. I served it with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and a cold glass of Guinness. Cheers!

Made this for a party and it was a huge success. Unbelievably moist and delicious. I used chocolate stout and added a little Kaluha to the icing. I will make it again, but make 2 nine inch cakes and/or cupcakes. I found the 3 layer cake hard to deal with and hard to make attractive.

This is my favorite chocolate cake in my very large recipe collection. I don't change a single ingredient, but find the three layer cake too big. But, waste not want not...right?! So, I bake two layer cake instead, and with the rest of the batter, bake cupcakes to freeze. When I'm ready to defrost them, I serve the un-iced cupcakes split and filled with either vanilla or Guinness Stout ice cream, and then melt some of the leftover icing and drizzle it over the dessert...yum!

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever had. I,ve made it many times, everyone that has it asks me for the receipe. I have also made cupcakes with carmel centers. 1 tip is always used the best quality chocolate you can afford it does make a difference.

I am passing along reviews from the people who ate this after I made it. Several people told me they don't usually like cake but they were mad for it. The entire thing was gone in about 15 minutes. I did make some minor changes-- I followed the tips about baking at 325. I also added about 1/4 c. of stout to the ganache. Quality ingredients make all the difference, especially in the ganache. I used Ghirardelli chocolate and sweetened it with about 1/3 c. of sugar because my friend whose birthday I baked this for likes sweeter chocolate. I didn't have much time to cool the ganache so, after about 10 minutes in the refrigerator, I put it in the freezer and mixed it every five minutes for about 25-30 minutes total. It turned out perfect. My friend was over the moon and said it was the best cake she's ever had. Many asked for the recipe and another friend asked that I make this for her upcoming birthday. This will definitely be my go-to cake.

I am going to make this recipe again for easter (even though it is pretty heavy for spring) just because it was such a hit when I made it for my friend's birthday....it is truly delicious, chocolate heaven! A few tips: This makes way too much batter, the perfect amount would be about half the batter for about a 2 layer cake. For the amount of batter, the ganache does not make enough to cover the cake even wehn spread thinly (which is all you need anyway since it is so rich. Don't chill the ganache too much, or will have to heart it back up to get it to spread. I also added some beer to the frosting as well: for both the cake and frosting, I used a blend of coffee stout and porter...

An (now) ex of mine made this for my birthday cake years ago and friends still rave about it. So I decided to make it myself and while it turned out amazing, here's some really important tips to make sure all goes smoothly and presentation is just right: 1. This makes a huge amount of batter. Make sure you have a big bowl to fold all the ingredients in. Like 3 quarts. 2. I found 450 degrees to be too high. The cake started to get crispy around the edges after 30 mins and a little underdone in the middle. I'd experiment with 425 and a longer bake. 3. If I were making it again, I'd trim the edges of the cake so all uniform and easier to ice. 4. Don't let the ganache cool too much because it's hard to spread. Maybe let it cool after 20 mins, do a crumb layer on the cake, stick cake in fridge to cool down. After crumb layer becomes solid, I'd then add a final layer of ganache, which has been gently reheated in a double boiler. Anyway, these are just tips. It still tasted great, which is the most important thing!

This is one of the best chocolate (cup)cake recipes I've ever made (and I've tried dozens!) I used Guinness Stout, added Jameson to the ganache and iced the cupcakes with Bailey's Irish buttercream frosting. I made them for a St. Patty's day party and they were a hit. The recipe made about 3 1/2 dozen cupcakes, I bake them for about 18-20 min. People are still asking me about them!

I was looking for a good cake to make for St. Patrick's day and came across this one. It made 1 9x13 and 12 cupcakes. The cupckaes baked for about 18 minutes and the cake baked for about 28 minutes. I made an irish cream buttercream to frost it with instead of making the ganache. Everyone loved it! This is definitley one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever made. The Guiness added a nice touch and brought out the chocoalte nicely.

Scrumptious! Utterly moist, just sweet enough, rich in flavour with a wonderful texture/crumb. I used a bottle of Young's Double Chocolate Stout and it was absolute heaven. Do be diligent with stirring your ganache and you'll be rewarded with a smooth, decadent frosting. I served this alongside whipped cream spiked with irish cream. Divine.

Hands down the best chocolate cake I have ever had. This is my new "go to" chocolate cake recipe. Cupcakes work well too. Will make around 3 dozen. Do not overfill as batter is dense and sticky and will stick to pan. I glazed cupcakes while frosting was still slightly warm and that worked well. Can't say enough...

I have made this cake three times. The first time it came out perfect - beginner's luck. The second time the center of the cakes fell but the taste was delicious. This time, the taste is amazing, but again the centers are a little low. Here is what I use: in icing, Scharffen Berger chocolate - half bittersweet (70%) and half semisweet (62%) [quality chocolate makes a difference]; in cake, Hershey's Special Dark cocoa [makes a dark rich cake]; beer, Guinness Extra Stout [I have bought other beers recommended in these reviews but I like the Guinness just as well]. Here are some lessons learned: 1. Quality chocolate matters in this recipe; 2. The cake tastes better after a day or even two - the beer flavor mellows and blends with the cake; 3. If your icing is too thin, it hasn't chilled long enough; 4. If your icing is lumpy, you haven't whisked it long enough; 5. If you ignore the icing like I did this time, it will harden like a rock. If that happens, you can heat it on the stove for a few seconds and then whip it to a usable consistency - you will get chocolate whipped cream but it will still taste great; 6. Sifting everything helps - sift your cocoa powder, flour, etc; 7. A generous coating of PAM baking spray in a good pan makes the cakes pop right out - no parchment paper needed; 8. Trust your instincts on the doneness of the cake - mine test done but look shiny in the middle, and I take them out and the middles fall. Next time I will try 325 instead of 350, and maybe a few minutes longer in the oven; 9. This cake freezes well. I take leftover slices and wrap well in press-and-seal and freeze that way. Enjoy!

just made for second time and got the frosting perfect this time!! One must be sure to not allow the whipping cream to go beyond the point of simmer....if you do, then it won't thicken as that happened the 1st time. This time, I was diligent and the frosting was exactly the same consistency as at the Brewery when I had the fatal slice of cake that has hooked me forever....I will bake my OWN birthday cake from now on...this will replace a choc mousse "bomb" cake that I thought was the best..... I baked this Stout cake for my friend's birthday last nite and her family went absolutely wild for it....who wouldn't!? ENJOY! And SO easy to make!

I have made this cake twice now to rave reviews. The second time I halved the ingredients and it made two 8 inch cake pans without a problem. I also used no-fat greek style yogurt instead of sour cream. I used whatever stout beer I can get only one can or bottle instead of Guinness that you can only get in a pack of 6 here.

An absolutely divine chocolate cake - I made it for my chocoholic hubbie and just made it again for my chocoholic father-in-law. I cut the recipe in half and bake it in a bundt pan for 40-45 minutes. Phenomenal! One note - I learned my lesson re baking when I'm over-tired: when making it last night I didn't read the last section about mixing the batter carefully enough (I blamed it on the recipe's punctuation, but really, fatigue didn't help). Instead of folding the batter until it was combined, I used the electric mixer until is was (just barely) blended and realized my mistake too late. Alas, the cake was an utter disaster (and I'm not typically prone to baking disasters!) - it took forever to bake and broke coming out of the mold. So - no big surprise here - it really does need that delicate touch at the end. But I baked it again today and it came out beautifully. A favorite among favorites.

Wow. Easy and delicious. Best chocolate cake I have ever made. As per one of the previousreviews I made the frosting first. I made it in 3x9" pans and worked out and save me 18 slices. Will definately make it again.

Made for St. Patrick's day and making again this weekend for my fiance's bday. Cut the cake recipe in half and made 24 cupcakes and 1 ramekin for the baker. I used Guinness as that is what I had on hand for St. Patrick's Day and it came out perfectly. This is not a very sweet cake, but it is very moist with a tender small crumb. Additionally, I added 3 Tbspns of Baileys to the frosting for a festive touch and a little bite - and will continue to make the frosting that way.

After seeing how many people had difficulty incorporating the cocoa into the melted butter/stout mixture, I opted to sift the cocoa into a small bowl and then add enough of the hot butter/stout mixture to make a smooth paste. I stirred that into the remaining butter/stout mixture and it dissolved beautifully.

I'm an experienced baker, and this recipe is certainly simple enough (essentially a double-sized version of Nigella's), and I love pairing Guinness with chocolate, but I found the results to be boring - just ordinary dark, heavy, chocolate cake. As 414 people can't be wrong, I'm dumbfounded.

I hate beer---of any kind, but oh my, this cake is so good! I made half the recipe, baked it for 30-32 minutes in two 8 1/2inch springform pans. Used the Young's Double Chocolate Stout and it was fabulous. I refrigerated it over night (so happy to be able to do ahead!). The cake was very moist, the crumb very fine and the flavor out of this world!!! Quite possibly the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted!!

i'm usually not a big fan of chocolate cake, but this is delectable. i cut the recipe by a third because i thought 3 layers from the first time i tried it was too heavy. i would definitely suggest cutting it in half like many suggested (depending on how many people you plan on serving.) i used plain greek yogurt and it turned out fine. otherwise i highly suggest this cake & keeping it in the fridge because i think the icing holds up better that way. pace yourself though, the richness of the cake doesn't hit you until you're finished eating!

Amazingly good chocolate cake! I made this for my husbands birthday, with a large group of guys in attendance, and all who liked chocolate cake loved it! The taste of the stout comes through the flavor of the cake, so choose your stout carefully! I used Young's Double Chocolate Stout beer, purchased from Bev Mo, which is flavored with chocolate malt and real dark chocolate, and it was amazing! The adjustments I made to the recipe were to use 1/2 c. less sugar than recipe calls for, and add 2 tablespoons of vanilla extract. I also used cream cheese frosting instead of the whipped cream frosting in the recipe. This cake is similar to Nigella Lawson's Chocolate Guiness Cake (Google it), which uses vanilla extract and a cream cheese frosting.

I would just add to make the frosting before the cake batter to have time to chill. My outside fridge is cold, so it only took 1 hour.

Amazing chocolate cake! And so easy, too! Don't worry that you forgot to set the butter out to soften - you just melt it with the beer. It couldn't be easier. I baked this cake in two 9 inch cake pans and I put what batter I had left in a 5 inch pan. (I liked that I could sample the cake before I presented it to my family.) The layers rose nicely, the texture was moist and rich, and it looked the perfect birthday cake for my mom's 71st birthday. This is definitely my go-to chocolate cake from now on. Next time I might frost it with a white buttercream or cream cheese frosting just to mix it up a bit as the chocolate icing is somewhat heavy.

I made this for last night's dessert. It was a perfect finish to St Paddy's day dinner. Everyone looooved it!!! I used Guiness because I had some on hand. The stout is a beautiful compliment to the chocolate. It's more of a background flavor; there is no overwhelming booze flavor like there often is in desserts containing alcohol. The cake has a rich chocolate flavor and is ultra moist, yet light. Recipe is simple and straightforward with excellent deliciousness to effort ratio! I was only having six for dinner, so I cut the recipe in half. I used two 9" round cake pans and reduced cooking time to 28 minutes. After reading reviews I made sure to thoroughly butter the pans and line with parchment and butter that too. No prob releasing from the pan. Additionally, I didn't have sour cream so I used lowfat plain Greek yogurt, and that worked fine. Served with Bailey's whipped cream. Yum. Next time (if I have time) I'll make Bailey's ice cream ;P Even halved, this thing is massive--we all had a piece last night, my boyfriend and I shared a piece for dessert tonight and there are still a couple pieces left! I'll make this one again for sure!

Break out your "big" bowls.. and then get out ones bigger then that.. This makes a ton but it is totally worth it. I used young's double chocolate stout and it tastes fantastic..

I needed to make a cake for an event and boy am I glad I chose this one!!! I'll be brief since there are so many other great reviews on here: 1. I used Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout as someone recommended and it worked great; 2. I used 39" cake pans and still had enough extra batter to make 2 small samples in ramekins for testing (so yes, LOTS of batter...be sure your mixing bowl is HUGE); 3. There was not nearly enough frosting. I ended up making 1.5x the amount of frosting and probably should have just doubled it; 4. The cake is MUCH better on day 2, so make it ahead. I put it in the fridge overnight and then let it sit out all day on the 2nd day to come to room temp. The frosting held and the cake is much better at room temp; 5. I wanted to fancy it up a bit and covered the top with semi-sweet and white chocolate curls. This cake is delicious and an absolute show stopper, so do yourself a favor and make it!

This is an awesome cake! I've been making this cake for years and it has never failed to please and is often requested for birthday dinners and other special family occasions. One time saver is to use a good quality chocolate chip (I use Ghiradelli) rather than grate chocolate bars (which I did the first time I made the recipe). The cake is dense and moist (be sure to use the 8" by 2" pans, line with parchment, etc.) and you can't eat more than a small slice. It will feed at least 20 people! Enjoy!

All I can say is "WOW!!!" This recipe is a chocoholics dream come true! I made it over the weekend. It is extremely rich and moist and the ganache is to die for! My family loved it and my co-workers raved over it asking me for the recipe! Great compliments. This recipe is a keeper. I used Guiness stout and, instead of all sour cream as called for in the recipe, I used half of the sour cream and substituted other half with plain yogurt. I also added about a teaspoon of vanilla extract to the batter. Soooo yummmmmmyyyyy!

Like plenty of reviewers before me, I find this to be an excellent recipe. I replaced half the sour cream with yogurt and made a lighter frosting. I also halved the recipe, and everyone still found their portions sizes to be pretty big. It was quite a delicious cake and can't wait to make it again.

The cake part of this recipe is great-moist and delish. As for the frosting, I made it with Callebaut dark chocolate as written and it is NOT SWEET AT ALL. I had not read the other reviews who mostly used other frosting recipes. Maybe just substituting semi-sweet or adding some powdered sugar would fix that problem. The recipe makes a ton of batter.I followed it exactly and the 3-8" layers made a rediculously high cake. I just used two layers and frosted the single layer seperately. It is a costly cake to make. Used the Callebaut and Scharffenberger powder and it added up fast. But it was moist and delishious (how could a cake with four sticks of butter and sour cream be bad?) and with a few adjustments could be the best cake recipe ever.

Rating: 4
I'm not typically a huge chocolate fan, so was surprised to like this as much as I did. It was outstanding, particularly given how very easy it is to make. Followed the recipe exactly for the first time, but am looking forward to variations on the ganache, and also very much appreciate the suggestion of whiskey ganache cupcakes - that may be my next try. Excellent!

I made this for my new years eve dessert. I loved it and so did my husband and co-workers. I can't rate the frosting because I used a cream cheese frosting as I like the contrast with chocolate cakes, but the cake was really good. Very moist, yet dense, a very nice crumb. I also appreciated not having to chop up a bunch of chocolate, using the cocoa powder gave it a nice depth of flavor and was so simple. I really recommend using a good quality cocoa, I like to use Scharffenberger. It makes a huge three layer cake though, might half the recipe next time, the amount of batter was ridiculous!

I also live in Denver so followed the adjustments listed by claristotle. I used a coconut porter instead of a stout and it was excellent. Just note that the porter did not leave the cake with a coconut flavor. I made two 9" rounds and sliced them down the middle, filled them with Bavarian cream,and then topped with the frosting listed. It was excellent!

Absolutely wonderful cake! I have made it dozens of times with different stouts, and all turned out delicious. However, I think there is a clear stout winner: Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. It's my favorite stout and works beautifully with the rest of the flavors. I'm sticking with it. I live at high elevation and never tinkered with the recipe even though it rose too fast and was on the dry side. I did adjust my most recent batch, and it turned out fantastic and moist. I will be keeping the alterations. Altitude adjustments for 5280 ft: Preheat oven to 370 degrees, Add an additional 2T of stout, Subtract 2T butter, Subtract 4T sugar, Subtract 3/8t baking soda, Add an additional egg, Add an additional 1T sour cream. Bake for 30 minutes. Sometimes I find the delicious frosting to be a little on the runny side, even when chilled for over 2 hours. I think I will be adding more chocolate to see if it sets a little better.

I'm not one to review anything...ever. But I had to come and leave a comment on this cake. It was wonderful! I made it for my beer- enthusiast boyfriend and he was very happy! I halved the recipe and it was just the right amount for 2 - 8" pans. Instead of parchment paper, I greased the pans with butter & a little bit of vegetable oil and sprinkled with flour and cocoa powder. Instead of Guinness, I used Brookyln Brewery's Black Chocolate Stout (it's a winter seasonal brew) and it was wonderful! I didn't have the time to make my own icing -- Betty Crocker Whipped Chocolate did just the trick! It was a wonderful cake! Defintely added to my recipe box!

I never thought that I would find a better all-purpose cake recipe than what is on the back of Hershey's cocoa powder but this is it. I halved the recipe and made cupcakes (still made 22 cupcakes even halved) and my husband and I tried one before they were even cool. They have a rich, but not heavy taste. They almost have the texture of a pudding cake. Will definitely make this again though I will probably use a cream cheese frosting.

Okay, so I made cupcakes out of this recipe, not changing anything except to substitute 1/2 of the sour cream for low fat vanilla yogurt (I ran out of sour cream). The day that I made them, I have to say that I was not all that impressed. They seemed overwhelmingly 'stouty' to me, and the chocolate flavor was barely a whisper. However, after filling them with a Kahlua cream filling and refrigerating them overnight, these cupcakes turned into the most gloriously rich and dense cupcakes I have ever made. The stout flavor had sort of taken a back seat (but definitely did not disappear) to the rich chocolate flavor at this point. Oh my god, the cake is actually addictive. Such an interesting taste combination. I have not figured out what frosting to use for these little bundles of yummyness, but I am thinking something with liquer in it. Maybe Irish Cream frosting of some kind. This recipe is definitely a keeper; I think it will be my go- to cake recipe for St. Patricks's Day from now on. NOTE: definitely use UNSALTED butter, otherwise these will be too salty. The beer is already salty, plus with the additional salt added into the recipe you really don't want any more salt in the form of butter. I made the mistake of using salted butter, and I ended up adding about 1/2 cup more sugar to the batter to compensate for the saltiness.

BEST chocolate cake ever. Great texture, moist. Cake was very large recipe. I will make in 3 - 10" pans next time. I was a little short on frosting. I froze the portion we didn't eat and sliced subsequent nights for dessert, then warmed in microwave. OMG... Sooooooo good!

Yummy! I used fresh rasberries, and a thin layer of jam in between the cake layers to sweeten up the bitterweet chocolate ganache and to break up the heaviness of the chocolate. Made it for my boyfriend's birthday, he loved it.

Delicious (and seconded by others!) The recipe is quite large and a great excuse to buy a wonderful new mixing bowl. Used Guinness Extra Stout; had no issues with beer, butter, cocoa mixture when thoroughly mixed with a whisk as instructed. Baked it in a metal lasagna pan size 15"x 11"x 2" - at 350 degrees, left it in for 45 mins. Didn't have whipping cream & enough dark choc, so did a part-butter, half&half, powdered sugar, & melted dark choc with cocoa powder & touch of brewed coffee impromptu substitute. Chilled frosting while cake cooling. The guys cut not-quite-cooled cake and frosted their own pieces; a good way to go. Will freeze some w/o frosting for later. Definitely not for frequent consumption but a great recipe for our next large gathering.

This cake was great! I made 3 batches for a wedding cake (two 12" layers, three 9", three 6"...with four leftover jumbo cupcakes) and made a strawberry filling to go inside. Used Young's Double Chocolate Stout in the batter and a combination of semi and bittersweet for the ganache. Overall, very moist and sturdy cake with a dark chocolate flavor. Not too sweet at all! Also, it tasted less beery the second day, but not too much the first day anyway.

I did not like the cake, but then I do not like beer. The individual I made the cake for said he liked it. I would not make it again. It is very simple, makes a very large cake, the texture of the cake is very good and the amount of frosting is perfect. (I think those who have been having difficulties with the frosting did not chill it properly.)

I used half this recipe for 24 cupcakes and they are DELICIOUS. Instead of the whipped cream frosting, I made some regular white buttercream frosting and 4 days later, these cupcakes taste as good as the day I made them. I have made chocolate stout cupcakes before and they have always been dry or flavorless. These are moist and perfectly chocolatey with a tang of stout. Definitely the best I have ever tasted.

I made this for St. Paddy's day 2010. It is delicious, and I will make again to see if it will be MORE delicious with the correct amount of butter in it. I kept reading 2 sticks, not 2 cups. when I put the cake in the oven I was looking at the two extra sticks on my counter wondering why they were still there. That was when I realized my mistake. I think the icing is too thick and rich. i may try something different next time. the lack of the 2 sticks of butter didn't hurt the cake any.

I've made this cake a couple of times now and it can not miss. This is the best chocolate cake recipe I've ever come across. Don't cut the butter too much, for 1/2 the recipe I used only one stick just to see how it would work and it turned out a little dry. 1/2 the recipe makes a really good size cake that was plenty for a party with lots left over. I made a Bailey's Irish buttercream frosting and it was awesome. I will be making it again for a St.Paddy's day party (more butter this time) Do make this at least a day ahead. I really does get better as it sits. Slainte!

I have made this cake now so many times that it is known as our family cake - and people know if there is a special occasion at our house, te stout cake is coming out! It is, hands down, the best chocolate caks I have ever made. For those that have commented before, YES, when you melt the butter and add the cocoa, it makes a nasty looking mixture that looks like it "broke" but that is how it is every time, and does not affext the outcome of the cake. My favorite way to eat it is without the frosting....its better than a brownie.

MY DH thinks this cake too heavy, but I thought it perfect. I made half a recipe which was plenty for two 8" pans. I was worried about the quantity for pan size, but no problem.

Great cake! Moist and chocolatey! I made the whole recipe, made two cakes in 9in pans, and one batch of cupcakes. I made a raspberry frosting from fresh raspberries for the middle, and the chocolate icing for the exterior, decorated with fresh raspberries. The raspberry was necessary to cut some of the chocolatey sweetness.

I love this cake! I halved the recipe and used a 9x13 pan. I also used half whole wheat for the flour and half brown sugar, half regular since I was running low on baking supplies. It came out great, so I will always used half whole wheat from now on.

This is by far my favorite cake. I have made it several times over the past few years and have been blown away every time. I have made the full recipe, half recipe and even one third of the recipe. It is always moist, dense and decadent. This Christmas I frosted two layers and froze the third layer to use on New Years Day. I served it with whipped cream.

Please help. When I added the cocoa to the butter and stout it didn't turn smooth at all - it separated into a clear liquid and a brown sludge - I even threw out the first batch and started again because it looked so wrong. I ended up putting it into my batter (I quartered the recipe and made 12 cupcakes) and they came out fine. Is this what was supposed to happen? If not, what did I do wrong?

I made this recipe with no adjustments to ingredients. I wanted it for work and Christmas gifts so I did not make a full-sized cake. The recipe made 96 mini-cupcakes as well as two 6"x2" round cakes. At the suggestion of another reviewer, I poured the batter into a big Ziplock bag, and cut a tiny corner off, and used it like a large "pastry bag" to fill the paper-lined pans....worked like a charm! I used very high quality cocoa and chocolate; I learned a long time ago it makes a huge difference. The icing is very much like ganache (yum). I let it cool just a bit before dipping the cupcakes in it; it made a wonderfully easy glaze. By the time I was finished dipping 96 cupcakes, it was the perfect consistency to beautifully ice the two little cakes. Overall, VERY impressive and received rave reviews from LOTS of co-workers and friends. This is a keeper!

Made this for a co-worker's birthday. It was like eating a giant brownie!! I added some butter to the frosting to give a little more richness (as if it was really needed) and that made the frosting pop. This is definately worth taking the time to do again!

When I first made this cake and tasted the leftover crumbs in the baking pan I wasn't impressed. The next day I took it to work and WOW, the flavors melded nicely and it got rave reviews from co-workers and none left over to take home. Many wanted the recipe. It's expensive to make but worth it- and it does make a lot! I used Black Chocolate Stout instead of Guinises Stout. Delish!

Rating: 4
Really really really good. I wish I had used a bit semi-sweet as it was a pretty sophisticated taste with unsweetened and bitter only and i was serving a mixed crowd. Universally loved by everyone, very impressive presentation and easy. I am more a cook then a baker and had great success. Also, I used really fancy chocolate which I think is key.

Rating: 4
Like other reviewers, I make this cake on a regular basis. Most recently, I gave a piece to a friend/co-worker and she came back the next day asking me where I bought it... she was shocked when she found out I had made it! She took the recipe and made it herself for her family and they loved it. It's simple but elegant. It makes a very large batch, though, so I often split the recipe in half, which makes enough for 2 cake pans. And the chocolate ganache icing tops it right off (I make the full batch even when I half the cake batter recipe)!

holy moly! gr8 cake. I made cupcakes - 4 dozen of 'em. regular size. this recip makes tons of batter, which tastes quite scrumptious by itself. Yes, I licked the bowl. Washed it down real good with the rest of the Guinness. Happy Birthday Guinness!

This is quite possibly the most delicious chocolate cake I have ever had. I used Southern Tier's Creme Brulee stout in place of Guinness and its lovely vanilla aroma added beautifully to the flavor. I am definitely going to make this again, perhaps with a raspberry filling. Highly recommended.

Rating: 4
I make this cake for just about every major special occasion. It has the perfect amount of moisture and the beer and chocolate play off each other to produce a very unique and satisfying flavor. I do a variation on the icing. Instead I mix cocoa powder, powdered sugar and heavy whipping cream to make a light and fluffy topping and I top with fresh raspberries. To die for!

I use this recipe for a cake, cupcakes, and a 1/2 recipe for a snowman cake mold (sold by Williams-Sonoma). I often cut it in half since it really does make a huge cake. I would suggest to all users not to tamper with the recipe by reducing sugar, etc. because, unlike many recipes, this one appears to be perfect.

Rating: 3
you DEFINITELY have to make the frosting. by itself the cake is rather plain, or maybe it's because i drastically reduced the sugar? i made half the recipe and only used 1 1/4 + tbsp sugar, because another reviewer said they reduced the sugar without much change in taste. it's good though, because it's not too sweet, and the aftertaste is kinda alcohol-y and nice. i added some cognac into my frosting. the texture of the cake is also good, dense and chocolate cakey. do leave it to sit for a few days, it improves with time.

Rating: 4
This is seriously the BEST chocolate cake recipe I have ever made. I made a three tier: 12", 10" and 8". It took 3 batches of batter to make all the layers and it turned out beautifully! I have had several people ask for the recipe and others that said it is the best they have had. One friend loved that it is thicker, almost brownie like, than most chocolate cakes. He said, "It stays on the fork!" I definetly recommend this.

Rating: 3
I would give this 3.5 forks if I could. Really really good! For those who are wondering, as I was, there isn't a stout flavor in the finished case (I used Young's chocolate stout). There's an underlying note that your foodie/chocoholic friends might notice, but it certainly nothing that most people will pick up on - they'll just think it tastes great! I made 2/3 of a recipe (only had 1 cup sour cream), and used 2 cups AP flour with 1 cup cake flour, and the texture - while dense - was good. (btw, this made one 2" high 8" round and 20 regular cupcakes). Cut sugar to 2.5 cups. Final note - didn't use the icing from the recipe. Used the Foolproof Chocolate Frosting recipe from America's Test Kitchen. It was a great combination. Get that recipe while you can.

This is a great cake I made it for a potluck party in my office and it was gone in matter of minutes. Everyone loved it. I made a guinness logo using a pastry bag and green chocolate and placed it on top of the cake. It looked very professional.

The first time that I made this recipe, the icing turned out as a glaze. Yesterday, it was a beautiful icing. I have no idea why they were different, except that I may have paid more attention to the icing this time (stirred it every half hour over a 4 hour cooling period in the fridge). I used Young's Double Chocolate Stout in the batter, but didn't notice that it tasted much different than the one I made with Murphy's. I cut the sugar to 3 cups and the butter to 3 sticks with no noticeable difference to the taste. Next time - and there will surely be a next time - I will try 2 sticks of butter and 2.5 cups of sugar.

Oh my. Iced this cake last night and put it in the refrigerator, don't know if refrigeration was necessary. Just had a very thin sample this morning and it is amazing. Definitely a chocoholics dream come true! Can't wait to taste it after a day since reviewers say it is even better. Could not detect the Guinness, no one will guess the secret ingredient. A small piece is fine, it is very rich. I used Guinness Extra Stout, dutched cocoa and Guaradelli semi-sweet chips for the icing. And I did treat it as icing, chilling until it was icing consistency since I made 3 layers and wanted icing between each layer. Next time I may chill part for between the layers and use the rest as a ganache for the top. Made 3- 9" layers and that fit the pans perfectly. Baked at 350 for 40 minutes. Used waxed paper in the pans, sprayed with Baker's Secret, cooled for 10 minutes in pan and the layers popped right out. This cake has great possibilities for different icings, toppings and adaptations! The full recipe makes a huge (heavy!!) cake, but it is perfect for a large gathering.

This is wonderful cake, I always cool the icing and whip it. For some reason it makes us all very sleepy, far better than any drug.

I've made (and reviewed) this cake many, many times. Today, I inadvertently put in 2 sticks of butter instead of 4. The result: absolutely fantastic. The ridiculous amount of batter made a bundt cake, 12 regular cupcakes, 24 mini cupcakes and a mini springform pan cake. The cake freezes beautifully so I don't mind. I will continue to make this cake with half the amount of butter called for, because I truly didn't notice the difference!

I saw this cake at the Barrington Brewery a couple years ago and was too stuffed to order a piece. That's all right - I tracked down the recipe. I made it this past weekend for a birthday cake and just had a leftover slice this evening. It is rich, moist, chocolatey - and not too sweet! Truly the finest chocolate cake I've ever made or eaten.

Rating: 4
What a beautiful and delicious cake! I was a bit nervous about adding the Guiness, but the flavor mellowed quite a bit in the baking. I used 3/4 of the original recipe and baked it in 3 9-inch pans. I used a vanilla malted buttercream for the outside of the cake. I filled the cake with some left over chocolate caramel buttercream from the Sweet and Salty Cake published in Baked, the cookbook published by the owners of the Brooklyn bakery of the same name. This cake sliced like a dream, and tasted fabulous.

Halved recipe, First baked 4 dozen mini cupcakes (used paper liners), left extra batter out on counter. Then removed mini-cupcakes from pans... cleaned, cooled & relined them with papers and took remaining batter and I was able to make an additional 2 dozen mini cupcakes. They looked the same as the first ones. Oven set as recipe suggested, 350 degrees. I baked both times 15-16 minutes & they tested done with a toothpick. A note, I only filled the cupcakes 2/3+ full & they baked mostly flat a little above the liner, no drips or runny mess. The batter is extremely runny so I put it into a gallon size zip lock bag, cut the corner & used this to fill the cupcake tins.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cake! I have made it several times over the years and it never disappoints. I read a couple of the reviews posted that complained about the frosting. It IS NOT thick enough when you first make it, because it is still HOT. That does make a nice icing if you want to drizzle it on. But if you want traditional frosting, follow the directions, refridgerate (and stir) the frosting and have patience. The frosting comes out better than store bought for sure. Two notes: 1. I like to add sliced strawberries to the center ( I only make this a double layer cake) The berries break up the chocolate for a fresh little surprise. 2. I keep a container with a mixture of whole wheat and unbleached AP flours with a little wheat germ thrown into the mix for all of my baking. I recently made this cake with that. No one seemed to notice the difference, and I feel good knowing there is a little "healthiness" in this truly decadent cake.

Black and Tans (or Half-and-Halfs, depending on where you're from): I made half this recipe (using Guiness), also reducing the sugar to 1.5 cups. Then, I made a double recipe of the Stout Creme Anglaise, but using Harp instead of Guiness. I served chunks of cake topped with the creme anglaise in pint glasses -- it was a *big* hit.

I made this one for St. Pat's Day. Not sure why, but it took about 20 minutes more in the oven to finish baking. Excellent flavor, but 3 layers is a bit tall...will try cupcakes next time.

This cake is amazing--very chocolatey, without being too sweet. My only "complaint" is that it has to be an indulgence item only, as much fat and calories as it must contain. If not for that, I would bake this cake much more often. By the way, I have made this as a layer cake, as two single cakes, and as cupcakes. When doing cakes, I always heed the other reviews and make sure not to overfill any of the pans. The recipe does seem to make too much for the amount of pan it calls for, so I tend to add a few cupcakes or something into the baking mix for the rest of the batter.

Rating: 4
Wow! I've made the cake a few times and most recently made mini-cupcakes. The first time I made the big layer cake, and served about half of the cake to 15-20 people at a birthday party. My boyfriend at the time and I ate it for the next week and he brought some of it into work, as well! I most recently made half of the recipe into mini-cupcakes. I believe it made about 50 mini cupcakes. I dipped the cupcakes into slightly warm icing... and the best is you can eat more than one!

Rating: 3
I took others advice and made a 1/2 recipe into a bundt cake with the icing as a glaze (the texture really is a glaze, not frosting.) If you don't like Guinness, beware! There is a very distinctive stout aftertaste.

Yum, yum, yum, yum. I've made this several times, each time making the whole recipe which results in two cakes. I usually make a bundt cake with chocolate glaze; AND a two layer cake with raspberry preserves between the laywers and a chocolate butter cream frosting on the sides and top. Like semisweet chocolate more than bitterweet in the glaze.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe without any changes whatsoever...and it lasts forever! I was asked to make this for a party, and when my client said three layers was too big of a deal, I made cupcakes instead. For regular size cupcakes, use paper liners and bake for 22-25 minutes. Makes 48.

Rating: 3
I have mixed feelings about this cake. It is tall and lovely. I made it one day ahead, and felt like the texture was improved the day after I served it- bummer. The crumb is not very fine, and I had barely enough frosting to fill and frost it. Would I make it again? Probably not, although I may try it as a bundt as use the frosting as a glaze.

Rating: 4
This is the chocolate cake I've been looking for all my life! Moist, with intense chocolate flavor, easy to make... what could be wrong? I even made it for a friend's daughter's wedding, and it got rave reviews. The only drawback is that stout is not a staple in my kitchen -- or hasn't been, until now. I've bought a case of it so I can make this cake whenever I want to! The icing is also a winner -- thick, delicious, solid chocolate. My search is over!

I made these cakes last night so they could sit for 3 days (before Valentine's Day) - despite reading all the reviews, I forgot that they would rise! I made a 1/2 batch and poured it in three little heart springform pans, and the cakes rose up almost 1.5 inches above the top of the pans - they look beautiful, (almost like monkeybread) although they lost their heart shape. I used the butter wrapper to grease the pans, as well as canola oil spray just in case, and they slipped right out of the springform crystal-clean, so there's not really a need for parchment paper. I cut the 3 puffy hearts in half, spread a thick layer of ganache, and then still had plenty for the sides and top, even with a 1/2 batch. I used a little more stout (double chocolate) just for fun, and splenda instead of sugar (so I'd feel a little less guilty), and I'm happy the ganache is so sweet (semi-sweet ghiradelli chocolate). I can't wait to try these in 3 days!

I know this is blasphemous, but I generally don't like chocolate cake. I just baked this for a friend's birthday who loves chocolate - and it's delicious! tried it with TJ's frozen bing cherries (thawed them, drained them reserving the juice, added some brandy, pomegranate "paste" (in the mediterranean stores), a smidge of almond extract, and a little bit of sugar to the juice and cooked it down, then cooled it and added the cherries). Its a great filling. yum all the way around.

I made this cake a couple days ago with full intentions to stick to the recipe and then lo and behold--I didn't have enough sugar. So, I substituted one cup for brown sugar and the cake was just fine. In fact, I have long been searching for that ultimate chocolate cake and I think I've found it. Between the layers, I put a layer of brandy-soaked dried sour cherries. I liked the contrast.

All right... I am trying to veganize this recipe, plus working with limited options here, so I substituted 1 mashed banana + 1 can of coconut milk for the sour cream and egg. For the frosting, I am substituting cocoa powder and powdered sugar with vegan margarine spread + soy milk, and I am planning to use raspberry preserves between. I will let you know how it turns out...

This cake is almost four forks worthy; I rate it 3 forks, the rest of the family says 4. I agree with previous reviews, the cake is much better after the second day, so if you plan on serving this for a special occasion I would highly recommend making the cake and frosting it 2 days prior to serving. I followed the recipe as written and used semi sweet chocolate for the frosting and also agree with others that this is not a sweet cake; definitely chocolatey though. I think I like the Double Chocolate Cake recipe just a tad more than this one; however this cake won rave reviews all around. Worth making but remember let it sit at room temp at least days before serving!

I made about 85 mini-cupcakes (baked for 10-11 minutes) using a half recipe (and one big cupcake!). I started to frost them, and it seemed like too much icing for such a little cupcake. I warmed the icing up a little bit... and dipped them. They turned out great, with just the right amount of icing.

This is an incredibly chocolate cake that isn't too sweet. In addition to frosting the cake with the chocolate icing, I add raspberry preserves between the layers along with the chocolate icing. Once the cake is frosted, I decorate it with large chocolate rosettes around the base of the cake. (I use a pastry bag with a large rosette tip.) Then I insert a fresh raspberry into the center of each rosette. I also drizzle dark chocolate on the top of the cake to complete the presentation. The last time I made this cake, I only had 3 matching pans with 1.5 inch sides, so I made cup cakes with the balance of batter. I decorated the top of each cupcake with a chocolate rosette and a raspberry. The kids loved them!

I reviewed this recipe a while ago when I used Hershey cocoa, but have since made it many times as written and DUTCH PROCESS COCOA IS A MUST. This cake is out of this world.

I made this recipe yesterday and used it for cupcakes. It turned out perfectly, garnered rave reviews and was compared to the best restaurant cakes! But do keep in mind- when the recipe calls for a large bowl it really means a LARGE bowl- this is a huge recipe (and may be a little to much for some hand mixers so keep that in mind). Very easy to put together. I used Bridgeport Black Strap Stout (though I'd like to try a chocolate stout next time for kicks).

OMG! I made this decadent cake into cupcakes for one of my best friends birthday and now I am begged over and over again to make them again! I'm not a huge baker or sweets eater but they were simple, amazing and everyone declared them one of the best cupcakes they had ever eaten. I did my own variation of course. I halved the recipe which gave me about 36 cupcakes, added a hersheys truffle kiss into the center right before I put them in the oven and then topped them off with tequila cinnamon whip cream when they cooled. So amazing!

This has become the default birthday cake in our household. Stouts come in a wide range of styles, and I recommend experimenting to see which best suits your palate. North Coast's Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout  which already tastes like a fruit cake doused in espresso and coated with dark chocolate  turns this excellent recipe into something truly decadent.

Just a follow up regarding flour type: Pillsbury AP bleached flour or any cake flour will give you a much better texture/crumb than unbleached AP flour. Unbleached AP results in a rather coarse and dense texture...too coarse for such a delicate cake. Also, half the recipe fills 4 mini-bread pans perfectly.

Astonishing! Very easy to make, amazing taste, perfect moisture, excellent crumb. 10 forks! I suspect the variety of experiences reflects the quality of the ingredients used. I used Callebaut cocoa powder and Young's Double Chocolate Stout (the large cans provide 2 cups). Results may also vary given the flour used. I have used Pillsbury unbleached...will try bleached to see if texture becomes a bit firmer...unbleached results in a very tender cake, too tender, for example, for use as german chocolate cake base, but perfect for buttercream, whipped cream or ganache. I also use cocoa powder instead of flour to prep pans, which are straight-edged Chicago Metal pans (baked with parchment circles and cake strips). Comes out flawlessly after 10 minutes. Should be made the day before eating for best taste...no stout or yeast taste at all, just deep chocolate tones. Freezes beautifully. Halve the recipe for 2 or 3 8-inch pans or 1 or 2 9-inch. Full recipe requires 3 9-inch pans or 4 8-inch. This is the best chocolate cake recipe I have ever come across...for ease of making, simplicity of ingredients and overall taste, moisture and texture. And for adaptability...layer cake, bundt cake, cupcakes....all work extremely well. A must-have recipe.

I've made this twice now, once exactly as written and once with a white chocolate butter cream frosting and fresh strawberries. In both cases, I received rave reviews - and although the icing made it decadent, it is the cake that is the star in this recipe. Mmmmm.... Guinness...

I've made it a few times, absolutely beautiful. I've started halving the amount of butter though. I turned this cake into a 3 layer black forest cake and it was divine.

So now I have made this cake about two dozen times...it is definitely a winner. I have noticed in some of your reviews a common scenario of having too much batter.. I cut the recipe exactly in half,and it is the perfect amount for one bundt pan. What I like the best about this cake is that it gets better the second day and even the third! And it is so dense that it is very easy to cut, I got about 20 slices out of it and laid them out on a platter with strawberries...it looked fantastic.But what always matters in the end is how it tastes, and this cake DELIVERS!

I made this with a few modifications for altitude. I reduced the sugar & baking soda, & baked it in 2 9 inch & 1 8 inch pans. It ran over in my oven & made a terrible mess. It looked awful, but tasted good. Any suggestions on altitude modifications that would actually work? I'm at 5,000 feet.

This is a great chocolate cake, tender but dense, since I made it in a 12c bundt and a full pan of 6 mini- bundts. I used double chocolate stout, and I couldn't help myself I added mini- choc chips. When I do it again I will: half the butter, use light sour cream, skip the mini-chips (maybe) and maybe change which stout I use. I did use dutch process cocoa, which I think I would do again for it's mellowness and darkness. We served it with a creamcheese frosting, I think a ganache would be "too much." Or maybe no frosting just vanilla icecream! Anyway you stack it, definately one to play with some more, it's tough work but somebody's gotta do it...

Oh my goodness, this is to die for! I made if for a St. Patrick's dinner party. I served it to 12 people...then the guests took what was left...I couldn't stop them! They were raving. I used chocolate stout and two 9-inch round pans. Also did a different frosting, with bright green Ateco food coloring. The color contrast was amazingly delightful. I have lots of favorite chocolate recipes, this is now at the top of the list. Very dense and moist, exquisite flavor.

I made this cake for Easter and all I can say is that I had a religious experience after my first bite:) I used Hersheys Premium cocoa, not Dutch processed, Guinness Extra Stout , and this was by far the best cake I have ever eaten. I made the ganache as directed, however, I wanted a more fluffy frosting, so after I chelled the ganache, I whipped the ganache, 6Tbls butter,until fluffy, then added 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar and tsp vanilla until incorporated. Wow, is all I can say. Very, very rich, but worth it.

Rating: 4
This cake was delicious. I was horrified 1/2 way through cooking to realize I only used 2 sticks of butter not 4! Amazingly it was super moist. I wonder what I missed by only using 1/2 the butter? My only issue was that 2 hrs to chill the ganache was far too long. I took mine out 45 min early and could barely spread it. But great party recipe...I made a 2 layer for a work party and 1 layer for home!

Rating: 4
I've made this cake in the past, and it is amazing. A little labor intensive, but totally worth it. Definitely make sure the cake is completely cooled before icing or it can get a little messy. This time, we decided to make Irish Car Bomb Cupcakes using this cake recipe. We followed the instructions but accidentally only added half the amount of butter, and it turned out fine - still very moist. It made 4 dozen cupcakes. For the icing, we made a cream cheese frosting with Bailey's (2 c confectioners sugar, 2 sticks butter, 2 blocks cream cheese, 1 tbsp vanilla, 1 mini bottle of Bailey's) and they were a big hit at work!

This cake really is off the hook. Perfect ending for a traditional St Paddy's Day dinner. I always make half the recipe, put it into one 9 inch cake pan and skim off the top (before I grace it with the ganache) to make it level. Looks(and tastes) like it came from the bakery. The perfect chocolate cake.

This is quite possibly the best chocolate cake I've ever had. Not sickingly sweet, very rich and moist. A must have at all our family occasions.

I agree with everyone that this is a showstopping and delicious chocolate cake. Would give it 5 forks if I could. Here are some tips gleaned from making it many times. Use springform pans. Eliminates any chance of a problem getting layers out, guarantees very high layers without spills in the oven. Try using graduated pan sizes like a 10", 8" and 6" combination if you think one big tower isn't a look you like. Even with ordinary Hersheys cocoa and chocolate it is very very good but with high quality dutch process cocoa and Scharfenbarger it is sublime. Serve with a cream anglaise or the topping from the Guiness Goodness receipe also on this site for a nice presentation on the plate. I am not a particularly good baker, tend not to measure carefully, and yet this cake is incredible every time. If it doesn't work for you, you really have done something wrong and should try again (maybe with fresh ingredients?). Put the sour cream and egg in your largest mixing bowl, there will be something like 16 cups of batter when you are done. Sometimes I have whipped the ganache and put it only between the layers leaving the sides exposed. This is the cake you will become famous for.

The cake part of this recipe is amazing. It's not too sweet and you can subtly taste the stout. The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly. I thought the icing overpowered the cake. I think having 3 layers with all that icing is too much. I've since made a 9x13 single layer cake with a little icing on top. I left the cake in the pan so I didn't need to wait for the icing to cool and stiffen before pouring the icing on. I've also just made the cake part in various pans (9x13, bundt, 7x11). It's excellent without any icing. I've noticed that the cake improves with time. I recommend eating it a day after you make it. It's a lot moister.

Rating: 4
I am not usually the biggest fan of cakes since most are TOO sweet, but this cake won me over years ago -- I've made it literally dozens of times since then. It's a brilliant recipe. I've also experimented with other types of "stout" -- Newcastle worked really quite nicely as well. The ale seems to cut a bit of the sweetness. This is must-try cake for every baker!

I used to be a pastry chef and have made my fair share of great chocolate cakes. This one went over as well as the best of them. My husband and kids are over the moon ("you are the BEST mom ever") eating the leftovers. I thought the ganache frosting would be too much, so I just poured the batter into a bundt pan and baked for an hour. There was enough batter left over for a 9" round cake that made for great snacking. The cake kept wrapped and refrigerated for three days, but we cut into it last night and the leftovers will be gone shortly. So easy and quick to make. Definitely try it.

Over the years I have experimented with espresso coffee, sour cream and different types of coco. However, this is the best cake ever. My 18 year old daughter only eats chocolate cake and I made this for her birthday a few weeks ago. There were fighting for the last piece. I made one small adjustment to the recipe. Instead of using Guinness I used Dragon Beer which is Jamaican and is a tad sweeter than the Guinness. I cut back on the sugar by about  cup. The cake was so compact it had the texture of a brownie only smoother.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but after my success and delight with the Gramercy Tavern Gingerbread cake recipe that I made for the holidays(which uses stout), I am excited to find a chocolate cake recipe that also calls for stout.For this cake I will also use the chocolate stout. My question is for the reviewer who made the full recipe in a Limited Edition Nordic Ware 13 cup original bundt pan. I have been looking for that pan. On the Nordic Ware website, the only pan with 13 cup capacity is the Monkey Bread pan. The next highest is 12 cups.. can you help me here? I really want to make the full recipe like you did in the biggest bundt pan. Are you sure you have a 13 cup, or is it 12? Thanks, I look forward to making this recipe,I have read all the reviews and appreciate the tips!

This is the Best chocolate cake! I first made this for St. Patrick's day in 2003 to rave reviews. It is also the single most requested recipe I have. This time, I am making this cake for my daughter's fourth birthday. I have successfully made this in three 8" round, two 10"round pans, and this time I plan to use three 8" square pans for the princess castle look. I would highly reccomend the (easy) ganache, but in this case I will be using a vanilla buttercream. This cake, due to the buttered paper and the moistness of the stout, has the smoothest finish out of the pans. No trying to frost a crumbly mess!

I made this 2 Christmas's ago and everyone thought it was the best chocolate cake. Last year, I made something else and everyone was disappointed. I didn't make that mistake this year and made the cake with chocolate stout. It is over the top with the chocolate stout. I used 3 9 inch round cake pans. I made a double cake for one party and used the third layer for another party as a single layer cake. We served Graeter's Peppermint Stick ice cream with it and it was to die for!!

Absolutely this is the best chocolate cake I have EVER made. Furthermore, it is better than any chocolate cake I've ever enjoyed from a fine restaurant or a foodie friend. I clicked on the recipe out of curiosity and when I saw that 250 people had posted a review I knew I had to give it a go. The first time I made it I used Guinness and it was excellent. The second time I made it, I took the suggestion of several reviewers and used Brooklyn Brewery Chocolate Stout. The results were noticeably better. It was now outstanding. This recipe is a keeper and I will make it again and again. BTW, both times I used 9 inch pans. I can't imagine the batter fitting into 8" pans unless you also plan to make at least a dozen cupcakes.

fantastic. I did overfill the pans and ended up with a lot of trimming to make them stack right, so next time I'll use bigger pans, because this cake was worth every crumb. ganache was excellent too and will now become my default chocolate icing. it does take a full 2 hrs to set up.

I've had this cake before but never tried to make it. I was told it was idiot-proof. Tried to make it for my 21st birthday. The batter was great but I didn't have enough pan space for it.

Not the recipe's fault so I still gave it 4 forks and will try again another time.

In terms of taste, the cake was very good but not exceptional, even though the stout gave it an interesting dimension. However, recipe gets 4 forks for the whole package -- it is fast, easy (no mixer required!), and very robust to changes (backed half recipe in 9 by 13 pan - perfect). Can imagine that the full recipe in a huge layer cake would be a show stopper

Excellent cake. I made a few changes, but the cake is also delicious as is. I used Guinness, added 1 Tbsp. of malt to the batter and shortened the cooking time by about 8 minutes (which made for a fudgier texture.) The leftovers were delicious- I cut the cake into cubes, spread the icing over, covered with a layer of raspberries and poured over an amaretto sabayon, then toasted under the broiler. It was super rich and delicious... not for the faint of heart.

This is absolutely the best chocolate cake I have ever had, or probably ever will have. I have already made it on three separate occasions and everyone who has tasted it has raved about it. The cake turns out beautifully (the frosting has a lovely gloss to it), but it is giant, so unless you have a lot of people to feed or want a lot of leftovers on your hands, I would halve the recipe. I do a great deal of baking and honestly, unless you mess something up (it is a bit tricky to make) I don't know how you could not LOVE this cake!

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday party. There were about 16 of us so I made the full recipe but it was still way too big (3 nine inch cake pans). Should have taken the advice of others and halved the recipe as I ended up throwing about that much in the bin. Size aside, it was very moist and had a deep chocolatey flavour. It was also slightly dense but not as much as a brownie. I used Guinness and a whipped cream cheese frosting (no time to make ganache). Wouldn't make again...still looking for the ultimate chocolate cake :)

Very nice. My 8" pans didn't have 2" high sides and I was afraid the batter would overflow, so I used 4 pans. Three would have worked. My only recommendation would be to plan on some kind of garnish or decoration if presentation matters to you. My cake was a big (8" high) brown block that looked a little austere.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Bake it the day before you plan to serve it and you will be thrilled with the full chocolate flavor and tender texture. I baked a 3/4 batch in my 12 cup Nordic Bundt (exactly 60 minutes) and had enough batter left over for two cupcakes. I used the frosting as a glaze while the cake was still warm and covered it immediately with the hot icing mixture. Do this by putting a sheet of parchment under the cooling rack to catch the excess and tap the rack (and cake) on the counter to encourage the icing to run down the sides. If you miss spots, you can scrape up the puddle under the cake cooling rack and pour it over again. Tap the cake rack firmly on the counter and the icing will run down. The result is a shiny, glazed show stopper! My only regret was using top-quality 70% chocolate for the glaze. The chocolate amateurs and children thought the frosting was too rich. I recommend Toll House morsels or no more than 55% chocolate. The flavor of the cake is so intense you almost don't need frosting.

I made this cake for St Pats day and what a hit! first off, I didn't have 3 8" pans so I used 2 9", it increased the baking time about 10 min but worked fine.

I made this cake on St. Patrick's Day for a dinner party. It was a huge hit. The ganache is a little unwieldy - next time I will cool it down more before frosting the cake. I made two 8 inch layers and 12 cupcakes. I also subbed plain yogurt for the sour cream.

I would give this 3.5 forks if I could. My husband loved this cake....so much so he ate 1/3 of it before I could even put the ganache on. The cake itself does have an extra something from the stout that sets it apart from the standard chocolate cake. Its texture is a hybrid of the typical cake and a poundcake. I, however, still think that the double chocolate layer cake from this website is slightly better than this recipe. This recipe is a bit more straight forward though. I will definitely make this again. I halved the recipe and made a bundt cake...next time I will make the full recipe or 3/4. I was hoping for a bit more cake.

BEST.CAKE. EVER. Easy to make and so delish. This is my staple go-to chcolate cake. The stout flavour gives it a wonderful slightly bitter taste. If you like chocolate-yness and not sweetness you'll love this cake.

I'm planning on making it tomorrow for guests with a cream-cheese frosting. YUM.

I love this cake. It isn't too sweet, it was easy to mix up, I didn't even use a mixer, great texture. I think this would make a great wedding cake. I halved the recipe and used my bundt cake pan- perfect! It baked about 40 minutes. I had a piece while still warm and could taste the Guiness, but the next day the flavors had all mellowed and it was perfect. About the ganache, if you're doing the layers, the easiest way to do ganache is in the food processor and just set out at room temperature till the next day. It always turns out the perfect consistency that way.

I made this for my friend's birthday because he loves beer-- made with murphy's stout. It was incredibly impressive looking-- a GIANT three layer cake. Use your biggest mixing bowl, there is lots of batter! In summary, you won't be disappointed, and the beer in a cake is a great novelty ... it looks impressive- but I am still searching for the chocolate cake to add to my permanent repertoire.

It's okay, definitely not the best chocolate cake I've ever eaten, but not bad-if you're looking for an intense chocolate flavored cake this is not it. Used Murphy's Stout and used ganache icing when it was still pourable. I would make it again only because the idea of a beer cake entices people.

It was good, for sure, but I think the novelty of the ingredient is what sets this cake apart for me. As with other reviewers, I didn't need such a huge cake and halved it into a bundt pan. I baked it for 45 minutes, which was a little too long.

I used this recipe for my daughter's wedding cake. I filled the layers with raspberry jam and fresh berries plus a layer of the ganache icing, whipped. I poured the remainder of the icing over the cake before the icing had set. This made a perfect coating on which to place the fondant frosting. This is the moistest, densest, darkest chocolate cake I have ever had. The wedding guests just raved. I couldn't have been more pleased with this recipe. I used Hershey's Special Dark Dutch Processed Cocoa.

I baked this recipe for a friend's birthday two years in a row and people go wild for the deep chocolate flavor. The density is just right for perfect slices. Used two 10-inch pans and a white (wedding type) buttercream instead of the frosting recommended. Fool-proof even at higher altitudes!

This cake was great! I made it for my husbands birthday and had great reviews. Only a couple of people could taste the stout. I may use a stronger stout next time (I used oatmeal stout). My grandmother was testing the frosting as I was putting the cake together and suggested we "forget dinner" the frosting was so good. I had a ton of compliments on the frosting and the presentation of the cake. I used a semi sweet chocolate for the frosting. The cake was very dense and moist. It was rich but not overwhelming because it is not too sweet. I liked it better the next day. I will definitely be using this recipe again. It was easy to make and fun. This cake could feed 20.

Easy recipe to make. Fits perfectly in 3 10" x 2" round cake pans and result is a beautiful presentation and delicious cake that will feed at least 14. I have cut the recipe in half and placed in two 9" pans with good results for a smaller cake. Try it, you'll like it.

This was a very dense cake. It tasted good, but was a bit of a pain-in-the-neck to make. I would make it again but only for a very special occasion.

This is a wonderful cake. It is easy to make and quite impressive to look at. The cake is moist and wonderfully chocolately. One warning: this cake can be intimidating, both because of the inclusion of stout and because of the height of the cake. If you are making this to follow a big meal, or for less sophisticated folk, I suggest making it only two layers and just say its a chocolate cake. Once they are wowed you can tell them about the stout.

My husband calls this the coliseum cake because the three layers came out to the size of the damn Roman coliseum! It was enormous! Very chocolaty, good texture, but the size and height of the cake kind of freaked out my guests.

The cake is the most amazing chocolate cake I've ever tasted. It's incredibly moist. The frosting isn't that exciting, though, even with good quality chocolate. Something thicker would be better.

I just made cupcakes out of this recipe last night. It yielded a little over 40 cupcakes and everyone raved about how great they were. The flavor really is delicious and unique and the fact that the cake is a little on the dense/sturdy side helps if you want to use it for a bundt or cupcakes. I used Ghiradelli cocoa and a basic bittersweet chocolate from Trader Joe's, so nothing fancy and it was still fantastic. My only issue was that because i was frosting so many little cakes instead of one large layer cake, I couldn't work fast enough to get them all done before the frosting started to set and lose its sheen. I'm sure that was a baker's error though. Everyone should give this recipe a shot because it really is a wonderful cake!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday and it was a great hit - with both the adults and children. Nice and chocolately, dense and moist, not too sweet. I used Fuller's London Porter instead of the Guiness and it gave it a nice flavour. It goes excellent with milk, but for the adults, we offered a coffee porter which really brought out the rich chocolate taste. I made the full recipe for the cake and got two 9" rounds, twelve cupcakes, and six mini bundt cakes. Instead of the ganache, I used a favourite chocolate buttercream recipe. I froze the bundt cakes and will try those with the ganache for another occassion....

I basically used all the ingredients listed for the cake (and real Guinness), with exception of the sour cream (I used plain yogurt instead), but I made the cake my way! I have to say the result was very good. The batter was really immense and it yielded a really big, moist cake. My husband was thrilled!

WOW!!! I am a diehard chocoholic-this cake is amazing. Don't be fooled by the beer. I hate any beer. I was slightly hesitant to make this when I saw it had beer in it. It is not sweet. I always cut the sugar in my baking, except this one. It sounds like a lot of sugar, but it is not sweet. Just a deep rich chocolate flavor. I used 9" pans instead of 8" and it was perfect! If you love chocolate, you must make this cake!

Dear Lord was this tasty. I made this cake for a friend's birthday (but with a Chocolate Orange Buttercream from this site) and everyone went back for seconds. I headed everyone's advice about the large batter quantity. I ended up using a 9x13 rectangle and a 9-inch round for this cake and 9x13 only took about 40-45 mins. We've since made this again and even days after being in the fridge, this cake is delicious.

Rating: 3
I'd give it three, the group I made it for would say four. I am a chocoholic, but I'm enough of one that no chocolate cake I've had - this one included - has ever tasted chocolatey enough for me. I halved the recipe for both cake and frosting, and baked it in my buttered and floured 10" bundt pan (which had room to spare) for about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Dense, moist, flavorful, and almost stupidly easy to throw together. The ganache frosting puts it over the top, and should not be omitted. The bundt version I did easily served 16. I would certainly make this again.

I live in Great Barrington, so I've been to the brewery where this recipe originated many times and enjoyed their cakes for years. The recipe is great and easy to make. It faithfully reproduces the rich, moist flavor of the cake that I've come to love. Of course, it is best made with our local Black Bear stout, so I substitute that for the Guinness.

Rating: 3
Very easy recipe and very good. I made the whole recipe and made a bundt cake and 12 cupcakes (we ate A LOT of the batter). Poured warm ganache over cake and then used soft ganache to frost cupcakes. The flavor of the cake is very good-rich and yeasty, though I couldn't taste the beer at all (I used Guinness) which was a bit disappointing.

Rating: 3
This cake was really, really tasty. However, it was very rich and very dense and no one could finish even a 1/16th slice of it. I liked that it wan't too sweet, but given the effort involved I will look for a slightly less ambitious cake next time.

Made this cake yesterday and had a "minor" mishap -- but it was my fault. I only have 2 cake pans so I halved the recipe (not a problem), could only fine extra stout beer (not a problem), realized I had no parchment paper but thought since my pans were nonstick it would be fine (big problem). Needless to say half the cake stuck, had to scrape the other half out of the pans and used the frosting as glue. The taste is fabulous. Will make again after I buy parchment paper!

Oh. My. Gosh. This cake is great! Like other reviewers, I halved the recipe which made a perfect bundt cake. Icing was great, just as long as I kept it refrigerated, it worked just fine. I made this for my boyfriend for dinner and we both had seconds. So easy and simple to make, I highly recommend it.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted. Follow the recipe perfectly and it will turn out fantastic. It is a lot of batter, so I made a two tired cake with 12 cupcakes left over. The icing is great too, but watch-- one minute it is runny and the next it is hard. So keep your eye on it. I have never had so many compliments! It also freezes very well and tastes delicious right out of the freezer!

Big cake! Heavy cake! HUGE amount of batter, it didnt fit in my electric stand mixer! Had to use the big, deep top of a portable cake taker to mix it in! But it was a hit, everyone loved it, probably one of the better chocolate cakes that I've made! No problems with the cake or icing!

Rating: 4
I loved this cake and got lots of compliments on it! Like some of the other people had suggested, I halved the recipe and made a regular-sized (not a jumbo-sized) bundt cake instead. It was just enough batter for that. Since I did not have cream on hand, I made a simple buttercream icing instead of the one featured in this recipe, and I melted it to pour over the top. It was delicious! It is more dense than regular cake, almost like pound cake. You can taste the Guinness in it, especially when it is fresh out of the oven. But other people did not know that was the "secret ingredient" until I told them. The Guinness flavor being obvious really didn't bother ME, but if you want to let the flavor mellow a bit, let the cake sit overnight and eat it the next day instead - it will be perfect!

This is a fabulous recipe. I followed the recipe exactly using a Northwest microbrew stout - but as previous reviewers suggested I halved everything and baked it in a bundt pan. I buttered the pan well and used cocoa. I baked it in a convection oven at 335 for 35 min. It was wonderful. Moist, chocolatey - everything you can want in a cake. And the ganache was fine as is.

Rating: 4
this is one gorgeous bundt cake. I did not make the layers as the recipe called for, but rather used my new limited edition 13 cup original bundt cake pan from nordic ware. Some folks had tried to make this in their bundt and had too much batter left over. I suspect that their bundt was just too small. I purchased my Limited Edition from Chef's Catalog and have been thrilled with the big beautiful cakes it turns out. The chocolate stout cake is a keeper.

Decandent. Without a doubt, this is a great chocolate cake. Everyone who tried it thought it was terrific. Got a couple of raised eyebrows when I said it had Guiness in it, but after they tasted it there were nothing but smiles across the board. I made my ganache with the semisweet chocolate and had no problem frosting the cake with it chilled. I also thought the way the frosting hardened made it look rather pretty. Will defintely make again!

I made this recipe last night for a birthday party that was ladies only. All the ladies loved it! Some were helping themselves to seconds. And it was so easy to make! I did it quickly after work and before the party. I halved the recipe as many have recommended and it worked beautifully. I also used a bundt pan that I coated and then dusted with cocoa powder as another reader recommended. That worked great too! Although I needed to bake the cake for about 45, not 35, minutes. When it was done, the cake just slid out of the pan just ten minutes after leaving the oven! I did not use the ganache in the recipe. Rather, I used the ganache recipe submitted by an earlier commentator, and it was delicious and worked great. I just poured it over the cake, and let it collect around the edges of the cake and in the middle, and the ladies just loved it. However, I recommend this cake for adult gatherings. The ganache was too rich for my kids. But the ladies were in chocolate heaven. I really appreciated how easy this cake was, particularly since I had to prepare it after work, and in time for a 7:00pm party.

This was really, really good and we liked the stout flavor and intense chocolate of the cake. HOWEVER, I do think that my mother's cake, which I believe is on the back of the Hershey Cocoa can called "Black Magic Cake", is better. I will try to make this again since I ran out of Dutch Process Cocoa and had to use regular. It probably makes a difference.

I love this cake. so much. I like it just the way it is. I commented earlier about not wanting to add beer to the recipe because my room mate can't have alcohol for religious reasons (yes, I know it cooks off, but that's not the point). In any event, I've found a great way to substitute out the stout (although its really good with the stout). Use a good "near-beer" like Claustahler, something flavorful. Use it for all the stout called for, but minus 2 Tablespoons. Add 2 Tablespoons black strap molasses. This replicates the rich sweetness of stout!

This cake is awesome! I split the recipe in half and it was enough for a party of 7. I made it in a bundt pan because I didn't have any cake rounds and didn't feel like dealing with cupcakes. It was still awesome! I didn't change a thing, just cut it in half.

I find it rather stupid of someone who hates alcohol of any kind to make a cake that is called chocolate STOUT cake. Anyways.. this cake is so rich and flavorful. My family (from great grandparents to children) loved this cake. Makes so very much and is so rich that you only need a slice thats 1/4 inch!!! Feeds lots! Made it once with an English Ale called Hobgoblin and 1/4 cup more cocoa powder it was even better. Going to try it with some other beers now. Dreamy with macerated raspberries that are still tart!

I halved the recipe and it was enough for 2 8inch layers. The cake was moist and tasted better the second (and third) day. It wasn't my favorite becuz you could taste the stout in it and I'm not fan of liquor of any sort. Even my eldest child (with a sweet tooth that you woundn't beleive) didn't like it at all -- said it tasted like daddy's wine. So if you like a decidedly 'alcohol' taste to your cake, go for it. I'm going to try a different recipe next time.

Here is the frosting trick, borrowed from Martha Stewart's wedding book in the 80s.(her recipe for a chocolate grooms cake) Make the ganache as directed but let it cool to room temperature. DON'T put it in the fridge. Get out your beaters and whip the room temp ganache until it starts to get light -- it will not be like whipped cream, but it will be lighter and more spreadable than chilled ganache. Use that as the icing. It will NOT harden up like a truffle. It will be a little more dense than buttercream, but wonderful. If you want a glossy chocolate coat, make more ganache following the recipe (essentially, half and half cream and dark chocolate) and pour it over the iced cake after it cools (dont pour it over too hot or it will melt the ganache already on the cake). I made this cake on a saturday night for a Monday dinner, kept it under a dome and it was fresh and perfect when I cut into it. Really wonderful recipe; yields an enormous, impressive 3 layer cake. And I heartily second "the most delicious batter" pronouncement.

This is a wonderful recipe. Made almost as directed and served to company with rave reviews. The icing turned out perfect, I didn't refrigerate it just made a few hours in advance and let it sit. Warmed it slightly in the microwave before pouring over cake. Added some fresh berries and ta ta! Recipe comes together easy and makes 1 bundt cake and 2 doz cupcakes. Yum!

SO GOOD!!!! i used murphy's stout and trader joe's cocoa and chocolate. i halved it, i think it would still feed twelve, easy. i also used full fat greek yogurt instead of sour cream, cause i didn't realize about the sour cream until after i was home from the store. about the ganache, don't chill it. just let the cake cool completely, then pour the ganache over. kind of spread it around with a spatula. it's MUCH easier this way, and will look all shiny and stuff. the less you mess with it, the shinier it will be. also, bakery trick- rip off four strips of parchment or wax paper and place the cake on top on them. pour the ganache over and then at the end, you can just pull away the parchment strips and voila! no mess.

This was an amazing recipe. It has a rich, intense chocolate flavor that stays with you... a small piece will do you fine. If you are a batter eater it also has the finest tasting batter I've ever licked off a spoon. It is surprisingly easy to make and I see myself making this at least every St. Patrick's Day and probably much more often than that. I would even say it was the finest homemade chocolate cake I have baked. Everyone I served it too raved. It makes such a huge amount of cake though I brought one small pan of cake to my family's office sprinkled in powdered sugar and made a frosted layer cake with the other two cakes. A three layer cake would have been ridiculousy large. I used a cream cheese frosting, which was an excellent accomponiment, so I cannot comment on the ganache. If you are nervous about a cake made with beer... don't be. Let me set you at ease by saying it does not taste like beer but tastes more like coffee and intensifies the chocolate.

Rating: 4
My only quibble with this recipe is that the "icing" is actually a chocolate ganache, It doesn't set up like regular icing because it's essentially the same thing as chocolate truffle, and while it is nice and runny and glossy when warm, it will turn quite hard and truffle-like if allowed to sit. So I don't recommend the recipe's method of allowing the recipe to set up, and also, you probably will find the icing too stiff to put in a pastry bag. Ideally, you pour it over the cake layers and spread it out with an offset spatula or some other long flat cake spatula. (Using a mold to bake the cake, like a cathedral mold, will severely complicate this task and I do not recommend it unless you are capable of pouring with a very even, light hand while the ganache is still fairly warm). It's best to set the assembled cake layers on a wire rack set over a pan before pouring the ganache over the center of the assembled cake. Smooth the ganache out on top and let the excess ganache run over the sides. Smooth it out on the sides as it coats them. If the ganache has set up too much, reheat it in a double boiler and add a little more cream if necessary. To the cook who plans to see if it will "soften up" and be piped out of a pastry bag - I wouldn't try. If you are committed to doing something like that, either use my reheating method and fill the bag while the ganache is quite warm, or, after reheating, allow it to cool to about 120degrees and beat it in a thin stream into 2 sticks of butter that you have creamed until very fluffy. That might help soften it out enough. The cake was delicious. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 10" springform pan for 45 minutes when I realized two of my round cake pans had gone missing. After cooling and removing from the pan, I split it into two layers and made a two-layer, instead of the specified 3-layer, cake (which would have been huge).

I started too late in the evening on this cake but it was so easy and really CLEAN to make things went well until the icing which did NOT take 2 hours to set up. I put it in the freezer for 5 minutes at a time and stirred well and it set up in about 35 minutes. Unfortunately, I really wasn't sure I wanted to ice the cake, which I'd made in one of those silicone gothic cathedral type bundt pans [my first baking in it]. Nowhere in the recipe does it say anything about refrigerating everything after it's cooked. I wasn't sure if an iced cake or cupcakes (btw - one bundt cake and 24 cupcakes from this recipe)so I thought I'd do it in the morning and, uh-oh...the icing was definitely cement. I let it sit for a while but in the end cut about half of it out of the pan, put it in a mixing bowl, added a bit of milk and beat it into submission, but it's just not the same. I did ice the cupcakes but the gloss and smoothness were gone. Tonight, I am going to take the icing out as soon as I get home and see if setting out for a couple hours will soften it so I can put it in a pastry bag and squirt it on the crevices in the cake...the cupcakes went quickly and everyone loved them. One person said it was the best chocolate cake she'd ever had...Oh, and my new retro Sunbeam mixer-the kind with the motor driven bowl-really handled all those ingredients superbly. YAY!! [I printed out so many of the reviews with the good tips about different ingredients. I made this with Young's double chocolate stout. Next time I will try it with the MacKessons 3X stout and see if I can tell any difference...and there WILL be a next time!]

I loved this cake, but made a few substitutions for a 'healthier' version. First I subbed carob powder for chocolate. Then I used only 1.5 cups of sugar (succanat)and it was still deliciously sweet. I subbbed coconut oil for butter and only used 1 cup, plus 1/2 cup of applesauce. It was moist and sweet without being oily. I, too, put it into a bundt pan and had about 1/5 of the batter left over, so I made a mini loaf from it. Rave reviews from everyone!

Wonderful, I wish there were 5 forks! I don't like many chocolate cakes because they are usually too dry and sweet. But this one is so moist and not too sweet at all. I brought it to work and several people said it was the best chocolate cake they have ever had. It really is just wonderful. I think the stout really complements and enhances the chocolate flavor. And the four sticks of butter don't hurt either! Perfect!

I would like to try this recipe, and yet at this time I would like to help out the cook who couldn't serve the cake to the friend because of the alcohol. The alcohol evaporates when being combined and then heated for 35 minutes in such a hot oven, which makes it no longer alcoholic, so perhaps that could ease your mind about the recipe. It would be alcoholic if the Guiness were poured over the cake after baking. Almost every dessert has an alcoholic flavouring in the recipe (vanilla, almond extract, lemon extract, etc.). Some cookie recipes use as much as 1 tablespoon of vanilla plus another extract. I do not drink alcoholic beverages for religious reasons either. I hope this helps out.

Rating: 4
In reply to previous message about cooking the cake without alcohol...when you heat (i.e. bake or cook) anything with beer, liquor, etc. the alcohol evaporates off. You don't have to change the recipie for non-alcohol friends because beer adds ONLY great flavor, not the intoxicating effects.

Oh my! What a cake! I am quite the chocoholic, and I have to say this is one of the BEST chocolate cakes I've ever made/eaten. It was relatively easy to make, as far as cakes go. It was, as others say, not too sweet, but very flavorful, and very moist. I have to figure out a non-alcoholic replacement for the stout, as one of my friends couldn't eat the cake because of her religion. Does anyone have any suggestions for a replacement for the stout? Thanks!

This is one of the best cake recipes I ever made. I make it in a bundt pan and because it is so rich, instead of icing it, I whip heavy cream and put it in the center of the cake and people can add the desired amount. This is perfect for people who don't like real sweet deserts.

Unbelievable chocolate cake. Moist, dense chocolate flavor which is only slightly sweet. Perfect if, like me, you love dark chocolate. We followed the reviewers' recommendations and halved the recipe. It still filled a 13x9 rectangular pan and served 12 easily. Made it for a dinner party to rave reviews. Didn't make the frosting -- used our own chocolate buttercream. Would make it again in a heartbeat.

Loved it! Yes, it's big, but not preposterously so. The icing set up in the fridge like concrete--keep an eye on it so that it doesn't harden too much. The cake is very dense and delicious. Cut thin slices, or some people may get overwhelmed--the rest of us can come back for seconds!

My husband and I made this recipe for my dad's 60th birthday. We decided to try to make it lower in fat since my dad has heart issues and it turned out fantastic. Instead of using butter, we used half the amount of lite olive oil, draining the excess from the mixture after adding the cocoa. Then we used lite sour cream instead of regular sour cream in the other mixture. We also used fat free half and half for the icing. The cake turned out WONDERFUL! I recommend using these substitutes for anyone who's trying to cut some of the fat out of their diet!

This is my second time to make and I love this cake. I haven't tried the Double Chocolate layer cake but I can;t imagine that it could be better than this cake. I made the recipe and it was a huge cake...might want to make extra frosting. I could have used about a half cup more to make it really smooth and pretty.

First, let me say this cake is HUGE! Three-8" pans full to the top when baked. I kept having to move the ingredients to a larger bowl to be able to fold them together thoroughly. I only used 2 of the 3 layers and split them horizonally. I used plain whipped cream between the layers. Now...about the taste. I thought the cake was fantastic. I found it to have unique chocolate flavor unlike regular chocolate cakes. This is a good thing. It was dense and moist. My fiance, on the other hand, thought it was dry. I believe his opinion is rooted in how dense the cake is. I would definitely make again... but I'd proabably cut the recipe in half.

This cake has prompted me to write my first review. I had my doubts about the stout, but this cake is wonderful...dense, rich, and chocolatey, but not too sweet. It is a perfect chocolate cake to have with port...my husband loves it! I am looking forward to making this cake again....and again!

As so many other reviewers have said, this cake is awesome. I would like to emphasize that the flavor improves with age -- I've eaten pieces of these cakes one, two, and three days after they were baked, and it actually gets better! Also, I know everyone lurrrves Guiness, but if you have access to other stout, try it! I've used Rasputin, Mackeson XXX, and a few others. If you can find Mackeson XXX, definitely use that. The little taste you get from the extra alone is worth it.

I have made this cake 6 times in as many months. It is very easy and has always turned out beautifully. (Although it does involve washing a lot of dishes.) If you half the recipe, it still makes a substantial 2 layer cake that feeds 10-12 people. I use bittersweet Scharffenberger chocolate for the ganache, and it's fabulous. I (once) tried using a sour cream chocolate icing and it was much too sweet. Don't be tempted to use anything but the recommended ganache.

Impressive and showy! I made the cake for my sister's 50th birthday. She is a wonderful person and is the equivalent of a gourmet cook - so I wanted to make sure it was perfect. I used Bernard Callebaut cocoa and bittersweet chocolate and bought brand new 8" heavy aluminum cake pans from Williams & Sonoma. The cakes almost jumped out of the pan (I did grease and line pans as instructed as well). The cake all iced is 6" tall and was uniform without having to cut off the tops. I left the icing in the fridge too long so it was too stiff -just whipped it up as another reader had suggested and the cake iced beautifully. The cake keeps well in the fridge as we first ate it the second day. To keep it simple, I decorated the "Happy 50th" with Duncan's Hines whipped white icing and added a few showy pansies on and around the cake - it looked great. As my father always said, "Any cake is good - as long as it's chocolate." - and this cake did not disappoint - it is very CHOCOLATELY without being too sweet.

This is the definition of decadence. As noted, this recipe makes two 9" layers and 17 cupcakes. I did not have quite enough ganache to cover the whole thing. No one cared.

On the advice of other reviewers, I cut the recipe in half and poured batter into two eight-inch pans: it worked out perfectly for me, and not only because I didn't have to contend with overflowing cake pans but because there was a little stout left over, just for me!

I thought that the double chocolate layer cake on this site was the best chocolate cake I've ever had. But now, I'm second-guessing that assessment. This cake was, without a doubt, beyond compare. Not only was it impressive in stature and grandness, it was utterly moan-worthy. I ran out of white sugar (only had 2 3/4 cups), so I had to improvise a bit. I used a scant cup of brown sugar, then added about a cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips. The batter itself was to die for! I resisted the urge to scoop it into an ice cream cone and lap it up! Anyway, I had to use three 9-inch pans to accommodate all the batter, and I had no problem with the layers sticking to the pans or the cooling racks. They were perfectly moist with just the right amount of density and a fine crumb. I am convinced that the best chocolate cakes are enhanced with a strongly flavored liquid (e.g. coffee or espresso). And this cake, with the addition of Guinness Extra Stout, was no exception. Its rich, dark flavor was absolutely intense and amazing. Because the cake was not cloying, I wanted to ice it with something slightly sweeter. The ganache seemed like overkill in terms of the chocolate factor, so I decided to use cream cheese icing. Perfection! We had a winner! It complemented the cake so well that I cannot imagine icing it with anything else. And it looked beautiful. I would highly recommend, when assembling this masterpiece, using skewers to hold the layers together. After all, this recipe produces a monstrosity of a cake. Presentation, not unlike taste, is paramount, and what a pity it would be if these luscious layers were to slide or fall apart. Regardless, this is truly THE most scrumptious cake recipe I've come across on this invaluable, ingenious Web site. Thanks again epicurious for another awesome culinary experience!

I have made this cake three times. Its fun to make and I always have a little extra stout to drink while I cook. I am making this cake again at the request of a friend for her birthday. She says it would be better with a little berry sauce on the side. The cake is super moist and the chocolate is lovely - not fudgy. I don't like thick frostings - this one tastes nice and light (certainly not calories wise) Its a yum one.

I like to check up on this recipe every now and then to see how many yahoos try to make jokes about drinking the stout, rather than pouring into the recipe. Seems we're due for a few comments to that effect. Some people are sooo predictable!

I used 2 8" round pans and the remaining batter made well over a dozen cupcakes. I agree, this cake definitely was not anything to rave about. It is, indeed, moist, and the Guinness is a novel ingredient, but the cake lacked depth in flavor. There are definitely much better chocolate cake recipes out there. The frosting was delicious, but ganache is ALWAYS delicious!

Delicious and easy! I made this 3 times in the past month. After learning from my mistakes, the 3rd time I used these tips that I got from the other reviewers. I buttered the pans, used parchment paper, and buttered the parchment paper. The first time I tried the cooking spray and cocoa powder trick, but the top stuck to the pan. I used half semisweet and half milk chocolate (Ghirardelli)for the frosting and whisked it every 15 minutes. I only filled the pans slightly above half full.

made this for a gathering with friends, and it was a huge hit. I used Guinness and Hershey's Dutch Process cocoa, and the cake had a wonderful rich flavor. i used Scharffenberger semisweet (70% cocoa) for the frosting, and it was a great balance with the cake. Thanks to those who suggested halving the recipe - even half was plenty for 8 people.

I cannot believe so many people are RAVING over this cake. I made it because of the reviews and found it to be OK - thats it. Nothing really special! Yes, it is moist, but thats it really; I am puzzled by what everyone else LOVES about it?! If I was ever to make it again (which I doubt) I would add chocolate chips/ pieces and use as cupcakes, as another reviewer suggested. As for a FAB choclate cake - I am looking elsewhere!

As a chocoholic myself I concur that this recipe is fabulous- not too sweet and very moist. In fact, the moistness was the only thing that gave me a problem as the layers wanted to stick to the cooling racks. I used 9 inch pans (no 8-inch ones to be found here in the boonies) which still took about the same amount of time to bake. Rave reviews from family and co-workers; I'll definitely make this again and again. It was also interesting to learn that half a chocolate cake layer will not even phase a larcenous cattle dog (no matter what veterinary advice we've heard to the contrary!)

Fabulous cake. Brought it to a party and got rave reviews. I've made many recipes from this site before, but registered so I could rate this one! I added 3/4 c mini semisweet chips and used cream cheese frosting instead. Its really worth it to use a high-quality cocoa, makes for a far righer taste. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
Made this for St. Pat's day dinner as recommended by other reviewers: made 1 day ahead, 1/2 recipe and baked in bundt pan greased with butter and cocoa. Perfect. My oven must run a little hot as it baked in the same time recommended in the recipe for the entire cake. Used Gunniess Stout (not extra stout) and it was moist and delicious. Served without the icing. Instead used Emeril's recipe for homemade Guinness ice cream with bittersweet chocolate sauce for a combination nearing ecstatic - or so my guests faces and sighs of delight seemed to indicate! I will surely make this again. Thanks for the recipe and all the great tips from the reviewers.

This cake is sublime! It is rich chocolate, but the stout definitely keeps it from being too sweet. The frosting is reach and creamy and the recipe itself is very simple. A keeper!

This is a wonderful rich cake. It was perfect for my St Patricks day dinner. I think it desserves 4 forks because 5 people managed to eat the whole thing in less than 24 hours. It should be called the incredible dissapearing cake!

Great and simple recipe. I've never made a simpler cake than this one. You would never make cake from a box again with delicious recipes like this one. It 1/2-ing the recipe will yeild a lot. I think this is best as a one layer cake with one layer frosting.

wonderful!!! 1/2d the recipe and made cupcakes from it for my husband's birthday. I didn't make the frosting from this recipe though. I topped each with cream cheese frosting so the cupcakes actually looked like poured guinness with white foamy top. Huge hit.

I made this cake yesterday for an Irish party. I had a time constraint, so I used aluminum throw away cake pans. Big mistake! The cakes need the full two inches of side height. The cake overflowed onto my oven and smelled downright nasty as the batter burned. But, after all was said and done, the cake was outstanding. Didn't have time for cooling and setting to construct the layers, so I put each cake on a plate and poured the semi-cooled ganache over the cakes and presented our friends with a single layer of the most sinful chocolate cake ever. Had I layered it, the cake would have been about 7 inches tall! I may try to make it in layers with 9" pans for thinner layers. This is one rich cake.

Very rich recipe! Turned out great, though. Made it for my boyfriend for his 30th (he wasn't too thrilled about that part). Next time I will put raspberry jam in the middle to give some variety.

Thanks to many reviewers for this recipe. I went ahead and tried to make this cake last weekend, for my boyfriend's birthday. I should have, though, tested the recipe out before doing it on the same day I invited friends over. The cake is good, but I'm not falling in love with it. I halved the recipe (recommended by reviewers) and baked it in the "bundt" mold. The batter was not enough for the "bundt" mold though. I found that the baking time is a bit off as well. I think if I'll try it again, I'll do it in an hour ( I took the cake out at the recommended time by the recipe, and the middle of the bundt cake is still undone) The amount of chocolate in this recipe isn't enough, I think. I used 1 cup cocoa powder instead. All in all, it's a good and easy cake to do, but it's not "a dish beyond compare."

This is a great chocolate cake recipe. It is important to make this cake a full day before you plan to serve it. The taste definitely improves with age. I ate a piece on the first day, and was not impressed. Yesterday I ate another piece, and was greatly impressed. I think it is an even better recipe than the double chocolate cake recipe, that I also ice with Lindt bittersweet chocolate. It does make a very tall cake. It is also an excellent tasting cake. I took one reviewer's suggestion to heart, and after I buttered my pans, I dusted them with cocoa powder (Ghiradelli). It is important to use parchment paper. Wax paper is not a substitute. Do let the cakes cool before you unmold them. They slip out easily. I iced the cake with Lindt bittersweet chocolate and cream.

This cake is really moist and dense...and really good. I used a good quality microbrew stout which I think really made a difference.

This cake is OUTSTANDING. Definitely spend the few extra dollars on good quality cocoa (I used Ghiradelli) - it makes all the difference. This cake is the perfect richness and sweetness on it's own: it certainly doesn't need frosting.

The cake is amazing! The frosting is a bit over powering for the delicious cake, so I made my own frosting.

If you are watching your saturated fat intake, I substituted 1/2 of the butter with canola oil. The cake was still excellent and had a little more healthy fat in it.

I just got married and, impressed by all the other reviews, made this for my husband as his Groom's Cake. I'm not an experienced cake baker but it turned out beautiful, mountainous and rich, almost upstaging the three-tiered white wedding cake (baked by my sister -- we're a family of cooks). I definitely started my marriage off on a sweet note! Cheers for this cake.

The best chocolate cake I have ever made. Moist and delicous. Made 3/4 of the recipe for my bundt pan; used cooking spray and cocoa to grease pan in lieu of parchment paper as others suggested; baked for 85 minutes; did not frost but served with fresh cocoa whipped cream. Everyone loved it!!! Definitely a keeper.

WOW! With one week to spare before our annual Christmas dessert party, I needed a miracle and I got one! Just tested this cake for my family. It is THE BEST chocolate cake we've ever had. My 11 year old doesn't even like chocolate cake and she scarfed her slice down. We like our cakes extra moist and this one did the trick. The cake isn't very sweet, which allows the rich frosting to stand on its own. I cut the recipe in half and made a two-layer cake, used Hershey dutch-process cocoa and Ghirardelli semi-sweet chocolate for the frosting. Cooked for 25 minutes and it was perfect. Once I refrigerated the frosting, I stirred it every 10-15 minutes. After about an houra and a half, it was the perfect consistency. Can't wait to see my guests' reactions next weekend!

My boyfriend found this and we made it for my birthday, it was INCREDIBLE! Everyone loved it, only those with a real chocolate addiction can eat more than one piece in an evening :) We're making it to take to a friend's house for dinner and I can't wait to try Extra stout this time; I think it will make an even bolder cake! The icing is tricky but if you let it set in room temperature after being in the fridge it goes right back to spreading consistency and don't even worry about putting leftovers in the fridge it's much better at room temperature. Have fun!

I made this as a bundt cake for a friend's birthday. It was delicious and moist, but I was suprised that it didn't have more of a strong chocolate flavor. If I made it again I would try adding more cocoa powder or melted chocolate. Still, very good.

This is a good, very dense cake. Just a few bites will satisfy the greatest chocolate craving . . . better the second day . . . still, not quite as good as the chocolate ganache cake--a truly superlative recipe (and great for b-days). It was fun, though, revealing the secret ingredient :D

I've baked this cake several times including once for a friend's wedding. It's always a hit and always turns out perfectly. I also recommend spending the extra dough for good quality cocoa. It makes all the difference in the world. My variation - I grease the cake pans and then dust them with cocoa instead using parchment as is recommended in the recipe and the cakes turn out of the pans like a dream.

Rating: 4
I've made this cake twice now and have loved it every time. I highly recommend using very high-grade cocoa powder and chocolate--it is worth the price! Also, it makes a ton of batter, but I have baked two cake sections in 9-inch round pans, and then made a batch of cupcakes with the leftover batter. Cupcakes are always a hit.

Rating: 3
I made this for a St. Patrick's day party as cupcakes (lots and lots of cupcakes). I think I baked them for about 15-20 min. They turned out fabulously. Definately one for dark chocolate lovers. I used Scharffenberger semi-sweet (62%) for both cake & icing but ended up adding some milk chocolate to the icing b/c I thought it was a bit too bitter.

Rating: 4
This cake was amazing! I made it for an office birthday this morning and every last crumb is gone. I was so scared about the Guiness but it just added this wonderful darkness to the flavor. I used semisweet chocolate for the icing and am glad I did; bittersweet would not have been sweet enough! This recipe is a keeper.

Rating: 3
My guests raved, but it was a little too dense for my taste. It is definitely a huge cake (feeds 16-20), and I'm convinced that the 8" pans specified is a mistake. I used 3 9" Chicago Metallic pans, baked at 325 for 35 minutes and it came out perfect and nicely proportioned. The biggest problem was that my 30 yr. old 4.5 qt. Kitchen Aid mixer was filled to the brim. Be careful with the icing. It does take a couple hours to set, but can very quickly go from perfect spreading consistency to too hard.

After my sister told me about this cake, I had to make it for a party of 20! It turned out great, got so much complements. I made it in a 12 inch wedding cake pan. I cut it in half, moitened (didn't need it)it with marsala wine (for contrast), spread raspberry jam(thin), sandwiched cake, spread the chocolate sauce on top, and garnished top with fresh raspberries. I served (on side) whipped cream mixed with cream frache,and marsala wine...I got so much complement (including presentation) that I had to write to show my gratitute for the owner of the recipe, and this great website that my husband said I am addicted to. Thanks!

This cake is HUGE... 4 8inch pans in the convection oven for 33 minutes at 325 did the trick. Icing was no trouble - in fact when it's thoroughly chilled, its a little to tough to spread. Extra Dark Guiness Stout added depth of flavor ...Be prepared with large bowls and big appetites! Everyone loved the look and the taste

Quite good, although I would cut down on the amount of cream mixed with the chocolate, as it was a little too runny and didn't work well for spreading over the cake.

Had to try this cake. . . halved the recipe and made two layers in 8 inch foil pans. Pans were well-buttered and dusted with cocoa and with the recommended cooling time, cakes came out nicely. For the icing, used Valhrona (milk) chocolate. . . expensive, but I definitely tasted a difference! Anyway, the icing required a lot more time in the fridge. . . actually, I had initially put it in the freezer and it was only after 3 hours did it set up enough to use. Taste and texture-wise, this cake was more like a truffle: dense, intense, and decadent. I wonder if my substitution of baking powder affected the end result (didn't have baking soda, oops). Overall, a very nice dessert.

I just made this cake last night after reading all the great reviews. The cake was absolutley fabulous. I halved the recipe and baked it in a bundt pan. I had a little trouble getting it out of the pan, but not enough to cause major problems. I covered the cake with ganache. The cake has a deep, dark, rich flavor. You know that something is different, but you would never know that it has Guiness unless you asked. I would definitely make this again. Actually, I'm going to make it for a St. Patrick's Day party.

Rating: 4
I have made this recipe twice, and recommend it highly. Quite easy. I found the waxed paper lining to be very important -- even with butter and flour I had the cake stick to the pan. Also, the cake is ENORMOUS, so I recommend making 3/4 of a recipe and using two 9" cake pans, then splitting the layers. (You will still need a full frosting recipe.) The cake as written is -- in my opinion -- so large as to be disproportionate and unattractive. The smaller version will still feed 16-20.

Rating: 4
This is the best chocolate cake I've ever made, and my whole family loved it! Our new favourite.

Rating: 4
This is an excellent cake! This recipe is a consistent crowd pleaser. The cocoa and stout make a very dark cake. I did not have stout so I used coffee this time. I also use 9 inch pans, since I do not have any 8 inch pans. It is important to use a toothpick or cake tester to see if the cakes are done. This time the icing was a bit runny but I suspect I did not let it cool down enough before I spread it. I recommend this recipe to first time bakers, it is not too difficult and you get some thing very impressive for your efforts.

Rating: 4
This is a wonderful special-ocassion cake! I made this over the weekend for a dinner party and it was a huge hit... the cake is three layers and huge, though, so watch out if you have to transport it. It is not super sweet, despite the 4 cups of sugar, and the guinness gave it a nice, strong, aroma. The sour cream makes the cake moist and creamy. I made the icing, too, and it was great -- very easy to work with and lends itself perfectly to the not-too-sweet cake. I will definitely be saving this recipe for future occassions calling for a chocolate cake!

This cake was absolutely amazing. Intense, rich chocolate flavor. The Guinness adds a lovely taste to the cake. I skipped the icing, but it was terrific without.

You're going to think I'm insane, but I added a half-pound of cooked, crumbled bacon to this recipe (for a friend who requested a chocolate bacon birthday cake), and it was GREAT. I made it as a bundt cake and made cupcakes out of the leftover batter. I thought the ganache frosting looked too rich, so I used the Marshmallow Chocolate Frosting recipe on this site but substituted stout for the milk to make stout icing... also delicious, and went well with this cake.

I just made this a few days ago. I was expecting something heavenly from all those previous reviews. It was really good, but I wouldn't say it's the best chocolate cake I've ever had. I used butter AND Baker's Joy on the pans and even though I was forced to wait about 30 minutes to remove the cakes from their pans (due to other circumstances apart from baking the cake) they slipped right out! The only advise I would give otherwise is make sure the cake is well cooled. It tasted really good warm, but as I iced and stacked the cakes, they kept slipping and falling over because they were so warm. Also, I'm not sure I was satisfied with the frosting, only because it seemed a little chunky to me. It just didn't have a normal frosting consistency. Perhaps it's not meant to, though. It was just my opinion. P.S. If you love rich chocolate desserts, try the fudgy raspberry bars on this site. They're to die for!

This cake is huge! My cake turned out very dense and moist. I think next time I will serve with some fresh whipped cream or a tall glass of milk!

Holy cow was this a big cake! It was good & rich(mostly because of the ganache that you frost it with), so cut small pieces. As far as chocolate cakes go, I still prefer the Old Fashioned Chocolate Cake with Cocoa Frosting from this website, but I would make this cake again.

Rating: 3
The cake was good, not as great as I expected though. I'm a true chocoholic and I didn't think it was dense enough. I made half the recipe, baked it in a bundt pan (non-stick, Criscoed and floured, had no problem getting it out of the pan) and left off the frosting, maybe next time I'll try it with the frosting. I used Young's Double Chocolate Stout and Droste cocoa powder, also, I frequently find most dessert recipes too sweet, so I usually cut the sugar by a quarter to a third, I used the full amount of sugar called for in this recipe and didn't think it was too sweet, as the stout cut the sweetness. For Thanksgiving I'm going to try the Double Chocolate layer cake (on this site), which many here have recommended, it uses about twice as much chocolate.

Rating: 4
This recipe was by far the most amazing chocolate cake I have ever tasted and/or made. I read all the reviews, which helped. I used extra stout Guinness (did not taste yeasty at all), half dutch processed store brand cocoa and half Ghiradelli (sp?) which was not dutch processed. Last 1/3 of a cup of sour cream was the light kind, I bought a too small container of the regular. I made 3- 9 inch layers (3 cups batter per pan) and 2- 8 inch layers. Baked at 325 instead of 350 (personal preference for layer cakes, I find that it produces a more level cake) and they were done in about 32 minutes. Froze the two 8 inch layers and frosted the 3 9 inch layers with a half recipe of the ganache. It was *just* enough ganache and set up no problem in my fridge in about 2 1/2 hours. Brought it to a dinner party, was told it was "good enough to sell". Yummy. The only problem I had was that I forgot the parchement paper and just used my standard shortening and flour that I keep pre-mixed. My 9 inch layers came out no problem after 10 minutes, but I got distracted on the 8 inch layers and left them in for about 20 minutes, so one broke up on de-panning. The moral is that you don't need the parchment if you are diligent about watching the time. While this is a very decadent and somewhat expensive cake, it was extremely easy to put together. I use a kitchen scale to ensure my pans are equally filled.

I LOVE this recipe. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and halved this recipe and baked in a bundt pan. I did not use the icing as suggested but have either served it plain or with chocolate sauce (a variation of the icing recipe: 1 cup half-and-half and about 1 lb bittersweet chocolate). I have made this numerous times for parties and I get rave reviews every time. It is best served hot, right out of the oven - very moist and rich. I don't like it as a leftover. By the way, you can't tell it's Guinness if you don't like stout beer.

Yum! This cake is fantastic. It had a very rich flavor and was a nice, solid cake. I halved the recipe and baked it in a bundt pan (added 5-10 min. baking time) and made 1/4 batch of frosting to pile on top. I used Young's Double Chocolate Stout to add some extra chocolate.. just in case. I'm going to try another with Bell's Cherry Stout, which has a very full cherry flavor and also add a bit of kirsch to the chocolate frosting.

Made this cake for my roommate's birthday. Got rave reviews from all. Perfect for a large party! Be warned that the cake is quite rich and quite large. The recipe says it serves 12 but we served 16 and we still have about a quarter of the cake leftover. Next time I make it, I'll halve the recipe.

I made this cake for my birthday and the result was excelent! I made half of the recipe, baked it on a tube pan and spreaded the coverture over the surface. Just one thing: I added some sugar to the coverture. For my taste it was too bitter, so I think next time I will use part milk chocolate and it will be perfect!

I cut the recipe in half and used two 9" rounds - worked wonderfully (and still served 8). The cake is great!

Rating: 3
I thought this cake was great- nice flavor and moist. I have to admit that I still have a slight preference for the double chocolate layer cake on this site, since the cake part of that recipe is more intensely chocolatey- probably due to the chocolate in the batter (in addition to the cocoa). Next time I'll add 4 oz. melted chocolate to this batter to see the effect. Obviously I like my chocolate cake rich! Also, I used Baker's Joy on the pans (instead of buttering/parchment paper, etc) and the cakes popped right out- no problem. Much easier too! One final note: this made three 9" layers plus about 10 cupcakes. When the cupcakes were still warm from the oven I could definitely taste the stout and thought it might overpower the cake. But after cooling and the next day, the stout isn't noticeable at all and just contributes to the nice flavor of this cake. Very good!!!

I omitted all the ingredients except for the stout, and it was fine. In fact, this recipe was doubled easily.

Used Young's Double Chocolate Stout from London (check stores selling imported beers), added a few drops of Boyajian orange oil and skipped the icing. Baked in paper-lined muffin and mini-muffin pans. They got better each day. Split a cupcake and fill with Nutella or peanut butter for Reese's Cups taste, or top the mini-muffin with either. Great to take to work or to a picnic.

This is a fine cake-although my knowledge of the dark chocolate/dark beer affinity has been supplanted by the dark chocolate/red wine affinity, this recipe intrigued me. Although I made a few forced substitutions due to poor planning-porter for stout, 3 squares of unsweetened choco for 1/2 c. cocoa, the cake was great. I used 3 9 inch cake pans, since I had no 8 inchers w/ 2 inch sides. Forgot about the cocoa dusting so many recommend (plus ran out of cocoa, hence the substitution). Pretty easy to make, aside from dealing with the volume-I love cakes that I don't have to remember to soften the butter to make! I served a single layer at a dinner party, poured the ganache after it had cooled a bit and embedded strawberries in the top-it was a big hit.

This is a very good cake and easy to make but not the best chocolate cake I have had by any means. It was moist and chocolaty, but I prefer a finer, more tender crumb. I think the Double Chocolate Cake is a much better cake than this one.

I made this as a birthday cake for myself:-) YUM! Absolutely delicious. Not too sweet, just right. Read all the comments before you make it. Some of the most helpful ones: this is one BIG cake. I should have halved the recipe. Instead, I made 2 8" layers and 18 cupcakes. I froze one layer and all the cupcakes for later. Make sure you start the eggs and sour cream in your largest mixing bowl, as that is the bowl that will end up with all the batter in it. My 4 1/2 qt. Kitchen-Aid was full to the brim. The butter-parchment paper-butter, and the correct cooling times seem to be key to getting the cake out of the pan. One of the reviewers recommended beating the frosting to make it fluffier, which seemed like a good idea to me. I think it worked well. However, if you are going to use it as a ganache, don't refrigerate it: just let it cool and it thickened nicely. This really is an incredibly good cake.

This cake- wow this cake- OMG this cake- not normal- not even close- this was by far the best cake I've ever tasted (and I am very jaded when it comes to food having come for a family of gourmet chefs) but this cake blew me away- we cut the recipe in half and used fine quality chocolate- and I served it to 13 people- never have we gone through a whole cake before- PEOPLE WERE LITERALLY LICKING THE CRUMBS! Nothing like this before and we have dinner parties all the time- people were going nuts- I was going nuts- I'm ready to make it again!!!!!

There are definitely two kinds of Guinness: stout, and extra stout. I used regular, for a half recipe, and had great results. The frosting, on the other hand, became rock hard once refrigerated past 90 minutes.

Excellent, not too sweet but very rich. Cake cut beautifully, excellent fine crumb, thin batter. Made it in 3 9-inch pans -- dust with cocoa over the buttered pan to prevent sticking. Used black cocoa powder from Baker's Catalogue for 1/4 of total to darken it almost to black. Next time will use 1/2 recipe ganache for filling and stabilized whipped cream for outside to lighten richness somewhat. Recommend air-insulated pans or at least cake strips to keep cake even in height.

Made this with friends this weekend. I delegated cutting out the wax paper, in place of parchment, to the men, and the butter/chocolate/Guinness prep to my other friend, which made it seem amazingly easy to put together. I halved the recipe and ended up with 2 9" layers. No problem with getting the cake out of the pans, which were non-stick. Everyone agreed that it was one of the best chocolate cakes they'd ever had.

Rating: 4
This is great. I made a half recipe which was enough to fill 12 individual (big muffin) size bundt cakes. With everyone's comments in mind, I used non-stick pans, buttered and coated with cocoa to make sure, and they didn't stick, but they did need to cool completely and it took careful removal for them to come out whole. The texture is very moist (with all the fat, it should be!) and the flavor is complex and not too sweet.

A chocoholic's fantasy fulfilled! Intense flavors without being overly sweet. Made this for company the other night and received raves all around. Leftovers went rather quickly as well. As for the frosting: it was still a little runny after 2 hrs., so I let it sit in the freezer to get to desired consistency. Also good to let cake sit in fridge after frosting to "set."

Very good, straightforward, simple recipe. Was in the oven in less than 10 minutes. The icing thickened up nicely in less than 2 hours.

This is a fabulous recipe resulting in a cake that's not too sweet or rich but delicious and moist and yummy! One thing, though, the icing recipe only made enough to cover a two layer cake. I ended up serving the third layer the next night - split in half and iced with whipped cream - also very yummy.

Wonderful cake, based on reviews I cut the recipe in half & still ended up with (2) 9 inch layers. Had no problems with sticking, parchment peeled right off. I didn`t have the ingredients for the frosting so we ate it plain....woo hoo, it would only make the cake more magnificent to add frosting, definately my new favorite chocolate cake recipe.

This cake is the best!!! It does make a lot though. I made this cake at Thanksgiving and ended up with four 8" rounds. I froze two and used them for Christmas. Everyone loved it.

I made this cake for my boyfriend who loves chocolate and Guiness Stout. Until this cake though, he had never eaten them together. What a combo! He, and every one who tried it, loved it. This recipe makes a lot of cake, but with a cake this good-that's not a bad thing at all! It's an easy recipe and since I made the frosting first, it was ready to go by the time the cakes had cooled. I will make this cake again, and again.

This is the best chocolate cake I have ever tasted! Not too sweet and intense chocolate flavor. I also had some problems with the cake sticking to the pan a little. One of the cake almost broke in half and pieces were falling off the other cakes. But I was able to patch it together with the frosting even though it wasn't very pretty. Everyone loved it and was very surprised that it had stout in it. I'm e-mailing this to my sister right now because I've been telling her how wonderful this cake is. Thank you!

Wonderful Cake! We had it in a pub and I was glad to find it on this site. It did make a ton of cake- I made 2 double layered ones (in 1.5 inch round pans). The first round stuck a bit, but the second one was fine. I used a professional baker's non stick spray in large quantities based on the some of the previous reviews. I don't even want to know how many calories are in this..

Another vote in favor of this cake. I made it in advance of a St. Patrick's Day party by freezing the three layers and frosting right before the party. It was a huge hit! I had leftovers for every item I served but not the cake. Try it!

Awesome cake! Dense, moist, delicious! Will certainly add to my favorites collection.

Loved the taste of this cake - very moist, not too sweet. Did not have 2" sides, so used the standard 1 1/2" sides and removed 2 cupcakes worth of batter so as not to overflow. Worked great. Had to cook cakes about 42 minutes for the ones in center of oven, 45 minutes for top of oven. No parchment needed, just use good non-stick pans with butter and tap gently out. Husband thought to throw last of his beer into batter as a joke (about 1/2 cup), but didn't affect batter. At last second I realized I didn't have enough chocolate for frosting, but 12 oz. choc w/ 1 1/2 c. of whipping cream was just enough for a thin layer for the whole cake.

This recipe halves easily -- more beer left over for the cook! ;-) I use a bundt pan when I make this as a half recipe. All it needs when done is a simple dusting of powdered sugar. Once you assemble the ingredients and get the pan ready, this is a simple cake to put together. I think this cake stays moist and delicious longer than most cakes. Flavor deepens the next day. An all-around great cake!

This is a GREAT cake. Dense, moist and not sickening sweet like some cakes, although it's certainly not for the faint of heart! Worth every calorie!

This cake is fantastic. I made this first for a large family gathering about a year ago, and ever since then I am asked to make it for every family get-together. It does make a HUGE amount of cake, but I also think it is fun to walk in with an eight inch tall chocolate cake. It comes out very dense but not overly sweet. The stout gives it a deep flavor that sets it apart from other traditional chocolate cakes. One cake should be able to serve a large group. Highly recommended.

My, was this good! I forgot to buy cream for the icing, so I made it in two loaf pans and added some bittersweet chocolate chips. This is really heavenly - so much darker and moister than I expected. I also was out of granulated sugar, so I had to use 'Sugar in the Raw'. The texture was fine despite of this, in fact it was fabulous. I didn't notice a pronounced flavor from the stout. It seemed to mellow the chocolate flavors and made it less sweet. I will be making this cake again and again. I forgot to mention on earlier post that I halved the recipe, otherwise there is no way this would fit in two loaf pans!

This is now my chocolate cake. I made as a birthday cake--made half the recipe and baked in two standard 8 inch pans (i.e., 1-1/2 inch sides, not 2 inch sides, which you have to buy at a cookware store). Baked layers for 1/2 hour. Perfect!!! The frosting was a little soft, but still great (used Valrhona from good old Trader Joes). I buttered pans, put parchment on bottom and buttered and floured pan and had no problem with sticking layers. Yummy!!!

Just one word-- DEELISH. I ended up with four layers; used three for a friend's birthday cake and one for our Valentine's Day treat. Not only does this cake look impressive, swirled with ganache, but it's a fabulous adult dessert. (With three children, we sometimes get a little tired of super-sweet, simple kid cakes.) I didn't use parchment, just sprayed the pans with Baker's Joy and had no problems with sticking. Can't wait for another big occasion to make this again. A tiny sliver satisfies, so you can get a lot of pieces from the cake. YUM!

boy does this make A LOT of cake. i did not have a bowl big enough for the batter so i mixed it by hand in a dutch oven. the cake was delicious and sufficiently chocolaty. i used a double chocolate stout i found at trader joes. i didn't have the right pan's called for so i made 12 cupcakes, a 2 layer round 8 in diameter cake, and a 8 in square cake(as i said, a lot of cake). i didn't bother with the frosting (although if i wasn't a cheap college student i would have), just used whipped cream.

Fantastic recipe, rates as my #2 recipe for chocolate cake (#1 is recipe Double Chocolate Layer Cake 101275 on this site). I think that this recipe is more 'adult' with a stronger, deeper and more intense flavour. People that love it will accept nothing else. But there will be those that won't, so my #1 choice is a more sure bet it my opinion. Regarding what a reviewer wrote below, I think all Guiness are called "extra stout". That's what I used and it didn't taste at all like yeast. Ganache recipe is simple and good. Overall this recipe uses slightly less ingredients and takes less effort to make, but costs quite a bit more due to the Guiness.

I made this for a large gathering at our house, and it was quite a success--very intense and rich, a totally satisfying chocolate cake. I bake a lot, and consider chocolate cake the ultimate dessert, and I'll definitely add this to my repertoire of 3-4 recipes I turn to, depending on the occasion. It is HUGE, a very high cake. I have 9-inch pans, and still seemed like way too much batter, but it worked. Took longer to bake and still fell a bit in middles of layers, but didn't ruin the look. A home-brewing friend had some coffee stout he wasn't totally satisfied with for drinking, so I used that, and it worked great.

I made this last August, knew I had lost the recipe and could probably find it here. The cake is huge, impressive and delicious. My daughters are still raving about the cake.

I wish I had read reviews before I made this cake. I can bake anything, so decided to make this cake for a party where I knew there would be some beer makers who appreciate stout. The cake was a total disaster--layers stuck to the pan and the parchment, and fell apart when I tried to put one on top of another. I have been able to rescue cakes when this has happened in the past, but it has never been this bad--the cake just fell apart! In adition, the frosting was not set after 3 hours in the refrigerator, even though the recipe suggests 2 hours.I managed to patch half of the cake together because the taste was good--it looked horrible. I have a big pile of chocolate mess in my kitchen that I will probably throw away, and a dent in my reputation as a gourmet baker.

I've made this recipie several times. It makes a very large cake, but it freezes very well, so make extra layers! To help with frosting the cake, try freezing the cake first. This will help get that crumb layer of frosting on. Also, freezing the finished cake is a great way of transporting without much danger of ruining the decoration.

I gave this recipe 3 forks based on potential only. I made it for a party and absolutely no one liked it. I'm an experienced baker, but know nothing about beer. When I looked for stout, all I could find was Guinness Extra Stout. Perhaps, I should have used regular Guinness which is not labeled stout on the bottle. Anyway, the cake tasted of yeast. Several people commented on it and I did not tell them what was in it. All that aside the cake's texture and sweetness is perfect. The amount of frosting seemed a bit skimpy, so I made 25% more. I would like to try this recipe with the regular Guinness. It has great potential.

This cake was wonderful. It's easy to make yet the taste is so sophisticated. My favorite thing about the cake is the way it tastes VERY chocolatey but not too sweet. One note: you may want to wait until after people have had a piece to tell them about the Guiness. It freaks some people out.

This recipe is wonderful. Currently living in Japan and attempting to bake without a Western-style oven, I steamed this cake. I was extremely impressed with the texture and subtle flavor of the cake. I certainly will make it again.

I was very excited to try this cake. I am a pretty proficient cake baker but had some trouble with this cake. I cut the recipe in half because I did not want the huge cake that everyone described. Maybe that was the problem, halving the recipe. The cake stuck to the buttered parchment paper( I have never had that happen before) and I had cooled it properly etc. It was very crumbly and the second layer actually broke in half when I tried to put it on top of the first layer. Doing the crumb coat of icing was almost impossible and the cake looked awful. Having said all that, I quite liked the taste and it was moist. My husband hated it and suggested I stick with my regular tried and true chocolate cake. I wonder, has anyone else halved it with the same results????? I almost think I will try it again following the recipe exactly.It got so many good reviews I feel it deserves another chance.

This is cake is rich, dense and delicious! Restaurant quality! I make three layers in 9 inch cake pans and it turned out perfectly. I started with the frosting and make it as written - if you leave it in the fridge and stir occasionally it will be the right consistency by the time your cake is mixed, baked and cooled. Do use quality chocolate for the frosting. I normally would use Lindt, but bought Nestle instead and wasn't as impressed. Enjoy!!!

Found the cake to be very big, actually wonder if it would work better in 9" pans, it was so tall! Anyway it was absolutely delicious, took it to a dinner party and everyone raved about, I now have emailed the host the recipe. Tasted even better the second day. A definite keeper.

Run, don't walk, to the store and buy Guinness now! I made this cake for my wife's birthday and she thought it was delicious. Do not be afraid of the stout. It adds a tremendous density to the cake both in terms of color and texture. I plan to make this cake for St. Patrick's Day. I modified the frosting to make it a bit thicker. I added confectioners sugar and beat it on high for three minutes or so, and then chilled it for a couple of hours. It worked great.

This recipe is simply fabulous. The resulting cake using the 8" pans is very large (plan ahead on how to store it -- it did not fit in any of my standard cake keepers). It is rich, very chocolately tasting cake with a great consistency. It does improve overnight and the flavor seems to intensify. Definitely a keeper!

This is a yummy chocolate cake recipe for any chocoholics. I was skeptical when I poured the batter into the cake pan - it was watery and bubbly (from the stout). The icing was a little too thin to spread but after refridgerating the iced cake overnight, the icing was just right for the very moist and decadent cake. Very good recipe, this.

This cake is the best. I didn't quite get the frosting right. It was too thin to spread. So I added a package of softened cream cheese, more confectioner's sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla and beat on high. It came out wonderful.

I love chocolate cake, as does my son, this cake is delicious! I actually forgot to add the baking soda ( I was using 2-9inch pans and 3/4 the recipe and got distracted doing the math) anyway, and put them in the oven and realized it about 5 minutes later, took them out, dumped the batter back into the bowl, added the soda, put them back in, and it STILL came out wonderful.

THIS RECIPE IS FANTASTIC. I WAS AFRAID OF THE BEER, BUT THE CAKE TURNED OUT THICK, RICH AND SOPHISTICATED. I MADE IT FOR A BIRTHDAY PARTY, AND THE FINISHED CAKE WAS 7" HIGH. THE GANACHE WAS SO FLUFFY AND THE CAKE SO MOIST THAT IT DIDN'T EVEN NEED A CRUMBCOAT. I USED 9" X 2" PANS. AFTER MAKING THE GANACHE I FROZE IT FOR ONE HOUR & BEAT IT ON HIGH SPEED FOR THREE MINS BEFORE FROSTING. MAKE THIS CAKE!

This cake is awesome...and even better the next day! It reminds me of my wedding cake that was actually a chocolate cake just like this, but with a whipped cream frosting and sprinkled with crushed almond roca in between the layers. I think I will try that next time...
