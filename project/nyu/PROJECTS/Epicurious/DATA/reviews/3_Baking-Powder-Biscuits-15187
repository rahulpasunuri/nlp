This was too salty. If I make this again I will cut the salt.

The most UN-Flakiest biscuits I've ever made...I think it had way too much liquid, as these were more akin to cream scones than biscuits.

This is incredibly easy and produces great results! I agree with the other reviewer; add more salt! I increased it to 3/4 tsp, but next time I'll use 1 tsp. Light, fluffy, delicious!

These were quick and easy. The only thing that I would change is the amount of salt. i think a little more salt would bring out more of a buttery flavor. I served these with homemade apple butter....mmmmmmmm good.

remember that if your biscuits don't rise like you think they should check your baking powder. this stuff does not last forever and the solution could lie in a fresh can from the store

I found these biscuits were nice in texture and taste. They are definately at their best on the first day. (The secret to not having hockey pucks, is not to over work the dough. The more you play with the dough, the tougher they will turn out)

Be careful when baking these - I overdid mine. Also, they didn't rise a whole - not that I expected them to, but the results are closer to hockey pucks than biscuits. I guess it's try, try, try again!
