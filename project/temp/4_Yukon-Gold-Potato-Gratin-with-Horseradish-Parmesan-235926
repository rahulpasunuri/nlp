Made for our family Easter dinner; it was well-liked by all, even the kids! I didn't have access to fresh horseradish, so used jarred. Definitely need to cut back the salt, maybe by half. Next time I might stir in additional fresh thyme leaves before baking to add some color. I had to transport it to my sister's house before baking it, I will wait to add the Parmesan next time. Driving caused the cream sauce to move around and sink the cheese. Delicious recipe all around, will be making again!

Made this for Christemas Eve dinner for 10 adults. Thought it was possibly the best potato dish I've ever made. Restaurant goodness. Used tips in reviews, such as halved the salt, minced the garlic and left in. Will most definitely make again! Served with the Roast Beef Tenderloin with Port Sauce, also a keeper.

Tried last night as tester for Christmas dinner. Outstanding - I used the correct amount of sea salt and it was not salty. However, I would use 1/2 milk, 1/2 cream as it was too rich for us. Used jar horseradish as another reviewer suggested. If I could give this recipe 5 forks, I would.

This is good, but I used a lot more horseradish than it called for and it still wasn't noticeable or distinct. It really adds a lot of depth, but I did want at least a hint of that heat and flavor. I think additional cheese stirred into the cream-potato mixture would add a little oomph to it, as well as what is baked on top. I didn't find the salt the least bit excessive, as other reviewers did. Went great with grilled steaks.

Absolutely divine. Even simplified (without fresh herbs and cheese cloth), it was the dish everyone raved about. It almost puts the rest of your meal to shame! I used freshly canned horseradish (ensure it is a fresh jar), used three tablespoons as suggested by another reviewer, and it still wasn't a very strong flavor. Next time, I'll add a little more garlic and horseradish. Still my favorite side dish thus far.

Oh my, this was crazy good! Had to change a couple things to fit what I already had on hand. Used heavy cream and half & half, ground pepper instead of whole. I did try to get fresh horseradish but had to settle for the bottled kind. Used about 2- 3 heaping teaspoons. Didn't bother with the whole tying everything together in a piece of cheesecloth thing and just threw in the fresh thyme and bay leaf & fished it out after the 10 minute simmer. Delightful flavor. Definitely a keeper!

Very good! Watch the salt, I use 1 1/2 teaspoons (high blood pressure) and that was enough. I think the recipe should have called for 2 teaspoons of salt.Good eats to all!! RS

Sorry, I forgot to add that I again used just 1T salt, and it was just right; not too salty and didn't need more. I used coarse sea salt.

Made this again but this time used fresh thyme and 4C heavy cream as called for, and it was absolutely heavenly! It was good enough the first time to make again, but this time absolute perfection! I chopped the garlic and left it in, and tripled the fresh horseradish, as another reviewer suggested. I also used part asiago cheese in the topping. Without a doubt the best potatoes au gratin I've ever tasted!

I made this for Christmas dinner to accompany a standing rib roast, and it was fantastic! Everyone raved about the dish. Per other reviewers, I cut the salt in half, and it was still quite salty enough. (I used granulated sea salt - maybe the recipe writer used coarse sea salt?) I used dried thyme leaves, and chopped the crushed garlic and left it in. I'm of the philosophy that 'there is no such thing as too much garlic,' but the garlic was not pronounced. And even though I doubled the grated fresh horseradish, it was barely detectable. I will definitely make this again, with the horseradish tripled, as one reviewer suggested.

This is so delicious! Even my picky children ate it and raved! I used 2 C cream and 2 C half and half as others suggested. I used all the salt, but it was sea salt, and I didn't think it was to much! A fabulous side! I made it with the Herbed Rib Roast http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/He rbed-Rib-Roast-104394 also from this website. Divine!!!!

wow! diluted the cream by half, with 2 cups of whole milk. used dried thyme sprinkled in, instead of a bunch of fresh thyme. didnt pick out the garlic. per the warnings of other reviewers, reduced the salt by 3/4. otherwise, made the recipe exactly as written. perfection! and we may weigh in at a pound or two more in the morning. probably worth it!

Wish I'd taken the time to read the reviews as I normally do, I'd have cut back on the salt AND increased the horseradish. Regardless - soooooo good. My husband is very miserly with compliments - so when he reacted with a big smile and "Good Spuds", I knew I had a winner!

Not a review yet - Only have bottled horseradish - can I use this?

Excellent dish. Horseradish added a subtle tang to the potatoes. A bit salty, but not offensively so. I did not have four cups of heavy cream, so, like some others, topped off what I did have with light cream. Will make again.

I served this with beautiful New York Strips and sauted vegetables for company last night. It was a huge hit. I forgot to put the garlic in and used 2 c. of cream & 2 c. of half and half and it was great. I did use only 1 T. of sea salt after reading the previous reviews and honestly I think it could have used the full 2 T. but only if you are using sea salt as it called for. I've never used fresh horseradish before. I was afraid it would be a little powerful but it was so subtle and perfect that even the 2 toddlers gobbled it up and asked for more. This is certainly a company worthy recipes.

GREAT but it would be better with less salt. I would try 4 tsp. Then taste the cream sauce after the potatoes simmer but before baking.

Definitely half the salt. Has wonderful flavor but too much salt took away from the herb flavoring. Very creamy and the crust on top is to die for. Would make again, but keep the main course simple due to the richness of this side dish.

After reading the reviews and knowing how much fat is in the the cream and cheese I lightened the load a little bit more by using 2 cups cream and 2 cups chicken broth and cut way back on the salt. Very delicious!

These are so good. I'm horrified at the amount of cream in them, but am willing to bite the bullet and make the sacrifice.... Well, at least once or twice a year.

This is absolutely delicious - you'll keep eating it even after your no longer hungry. I cut the salt in half because i was using regular. Fishing the garlic cloves out proved challenging given they were the same color as the cream and potatoes. Next time I will just press them in and leave them. I used a heaping 1/2 cup of jarred UNPREPARED horseradish instead of fresh. I also replaced 1/2 cup of the Parmesan with Asiago. I used the full amount of heavy cream and it was so rich. I think you could at least replace one carton with half and half without detracting from the recipe at all.

This was phenomenal. I did decrease the amount of salt by one third and still felt it was too salty. I must say also that I consider myself someone who likes salt too much! Everybody raved with these potatoes, though. I will make them again for sure.

We loved this! Fed the extended family yesterday and everyone raved. I used the full two tablespoons of salt and it seemed fine to everyone. I just wonder if others were using table salt instead of sea salt...

This was THE dish everyone swooned over at Christmas dinner. This is amazing. The horseradish isn't imposing at all but it adds a little bite that brightens up the dish.

Lighten up & reduce salt: Use 1+ cup of chicken stock like out of the box, and a pint of light cream. Smash or mince up the 5 cloves of garlic. Add some dried thyme, fresh ground white pepper, and a pinch of salt, and 1/2 a California bay leaf. Par boil the potato slices in this in a large nonstick saute pan. Transfer to a casserole sprayed with your choice of release agent. Pick out that bay leaf. Sprinkle another pinch or two of salt on the top, along with some fresh ground black pepper. Top with grated asagio cheese and parm for a more complex flavor & better melt. Bake & rest as per directions. Heaven with ham and broccoli. Horseradish optional, of course.

I brought this to a friend's Thanksgiving dinner last year and it stole the night. I didn't have tools for the bouguet garni but just kept those items near the top and was able to spoon them out easily. Next time I make it I plan on doubling the horseradish- the flavor isn't very present as is.

I followed the advice from "A cook from Berwyn, PA" and it came out great. The only difference was that I only used 1 cup of fresh horseradish. My family gave it 4 stars also.

I used the previous suggestions and we just love the way it comes out...Added some diced onions (can use shallots)

Thanks to the previous reviews I made several modifications to this recipe and made this way everyone in my family gave it 4 stars. First, the amount of hoseradish called for certainly would not add any flavor. I increased it to to 1 1/4 cups. Of course, this would only be if you are using fresh - this amount of the jarred stuff would kill you. Second, I cut the salt in half - if you are grating fresh parm it is very salty and half the amount will be plenty. Also, I used 1/2 cream and 1/2 half n' half. Lastly, I served this dish with pork which it complimented very well. I think it is too rich to serve with beef.

Watch out for the salt -- use less. My wife does not like horseradish, so I made two versions - one with and one without. Both were good. It is rich, but that's the point of a gratin, right? I would agree that they should drop the "healthy" flag.

This wasn't really that good. Kind of bland. I was disappointed by the reviews.

I tired this last night as a Christmas tester. There was WAY TOO much salt and tons of cream left over. I am going to try again as I think it has potential but will cut back on the cream and potatoes and use one quarter of the salt. Any advise from those who tried it? .

This is by far one of the best potato's I have ever made. I didn't use the bag of spices but I did put in black pepper, salt and onion powder. I also put a little fontina cheese in it. Yum!!!!

This potato dish was wonderful. I hate to cook but needed a good recipe for a work related dinner party. It was a grand success and the guys were dipping the bread into the cheesy sauce to get every drop. I actually made the first part of the recipe a couple hours ahead of time. When ready, I added the cheese and put in oven for 40 minutes; it was great.

How is this healthy? 4 cups of heavy cream & 1 and 1/2 cups cheese?

Do you really boil the cream? I thought that was a no-no. MOM
