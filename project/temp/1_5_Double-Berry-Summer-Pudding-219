I think the thawed frozen yogurt is supposed to be an substitute for creme anglaise. If that's the disired outcome, better to use thawed good, rich vanilla ice cream. I also agree that fresh berries and day old bread are the way to go.

Light & easy spin off of the traditional Summer Pudding. The Angel food cake dissolved under the pressure of the fruit syrup and I also agree that the thawed frozen yogourt was ugh! I'll try again with a larger variety of beautiful British Columbia's soft fruits in season and I'll stick to my plain old french bread instead of the cake. Otherwise Summer Pudding is deliciously sweet and irresistible.
