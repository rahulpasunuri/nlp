Delicious, easy to make, and can be prepared ahead. Perfect dinner party side. Don't skimp on the anchovies!

Made this today as a side for our Thanksgiving lasagna. Really tasty and really quick. Everyone loved it.

So simple and delicious. The salad was prepared exactly as written with escarole as the greens. I would be surprised that the yield would be much more than a tasting as I consumed half of the wilted greens at lunch. I used Prince Albert flat anchovies. Next time I will use boquerones (white anchovies). The fresh squeeze of lemon juice is essential.

Really love this recipe! I loved the bitterness of the dandelion greens mixed with the salty/savoriness of the anchovies and the slight sourness of the lemon juice. The flavors all went really well together, and was very easy to make.

Super good, easy. I used this as the topping for potato wraps. Definitely will make again.

Even my 5 year old liked them. The anchovies are key. Doubled the recipe and fed 4 generously.

Fabulous! Didn't change a thing. My husband said how much he loved it.

Amazing! I grew up on 'Scarole and beans' so I was so happy to find a new way to prepare escarole. Easy and quick - made it before dinner so it was room temp when we ate it and it was delicious. Anything with garlic and anchovies works for me. I'm making it again today and may add a few red pepper flakes for a kick. Definitely double or triple the recipe - it reduces so much and everyone wanted more.

I made this with sardines instead and chopped them into chunks before sauteing. I also added a quarter of a white onion and sauted that for 3-5 minutes before the fish went in. I used dandielion greens. I added lots of lemon and salt and pepper as sardines are not as salty. Very delicious and good way to use sardines as they have so many omega-3's.

This was the most flavorful dish served up at our dinner club "Italian" night. It beat out the overcooked pork braciole, the black truffle risotto, and even our appetitzers, (but not the tiramiso)! The good news is we didn't walk away needing a breath mint as the garlic was not overpowering - was a little worried about that. Have to say that we all wanted more, so my advise to you is to double the recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as specified using turnip greens. I usually chop the anchovies and in the future I'll chop them a little bit finer. This is truly a Sicilian recipe and tastes great! The lemon juice is a Sicilian touch. I'd recommend this for anyone looking for a change from Southern style greens and don't be afraid of the anchovies they give it a bit of flavor.

This is a pretty good recipe. I would rinse the anchovies a bit extra and exclude the salt, as the anchovies do provide plenty.

Amazing recipe. would not add additional salt after adding anchovies.

I had some turnip greens and found this recipe. So easy and tasty. It only took a couple minutes to saute and served over brown jasmine rice with a piece of alder smoked salmon. P.S. I only used a tablespoon of olive oil.

I've already made this twice this week. It's really delicious and kale is so good for you. Tonight I put it atop brown basmati rice and then topped it with with a fried egg. So good.

Excellent. I have used this recipe with turnip greens and mustard greens. When you don't have time you can replace the garlic and anchovies with a bit of garlic paste and it's still wonderful. I also love to use the stems of the greens, so I braise them and throw them into the mix at the end.
