I have to say that this dish looks beautiful. Not sure if I would make it again. The flavors are just ok. I used shallots instead of leeks because that is what I had on hand. I just feel like something was missing. Maybe add some cranraisins?

Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for this dish. I followed the recipe except used white wine to saute the leeks and added a bit of garlic as others suggested. It just didn't do it for us. I won't make it again.

Rating: 4
While I loved the recipe and would certainly make it again....the squash required more than the listed 15minutes to cook. Changes I made to the recipe: I added a diced apple (Golden Delicious) and used leeks, since I already had them, instead of onions. I also eliminated the corn, since I felt the recipe was sufficiently starchy. Excellent

Followed the recipe exactly and made with Black Wild Rice. The 2nd time I made it I used Chicken Stock instead of water to cook the rice in. It was delicious. One of our favorite recipes and so healthy. I've made it about 5x in the past few weeks, and for company and they raved about it & asked f/the recipe. Can add all sorts of vegetables once u get the recipe down; ie.asparagus. Very versatile recipe and delicious either as is or with your own influence.

Wonderful dish. My guests talked about it for weeks after my dinner. I served it with Duck a l'Orange. It was the savory dish that complimented the sweet dish. I recommend seeking out the pre-peeled and cubed squash, since that was the most time consuming aspect of preparing this dish. I made this the day before the dinner which was very helpful

As per other recommendations - used white onions, added white wine - still found it to be a little on the bland side- added a squeeze of lemon, mustard powder, chili flakes to brighten it up and it is delicious.

I made this for our Christmas dinner this year to accompany beef tenderloin and asparagus, and it was a huge hit. It's a beautiful dish: the small orange cubes against the beautiful brown wild rice, with specks of corn. It was delicious, satisfying, and a definite "will do again" recipe. Everyone loved the dish, even my mother who claims to not like wild rice.

Just made this for an office potluck lunch. Agreed with and followed the recommendations of extra leeks, a bit of garlic, white wine, etc. Used Black Japonica rice instead of wild. A bit easier on the pocket book but still got the beautiful contrast. When all said and done...needed something to brighten the flavor so hit it with a bit of lemon. Maybe it was because I didn't use the wild rice. I would also cook the squash in a hotter oven to get a bit of brown on it. It's heading on to the 2012 Thanksgiving menu.

Great side dish. Thank you to everyone who suggested that I use regular onions and white wine. I make this dish with half leeks and half sweet onions. I used white wine in place of the water. It still was a mild side dish, so I'm guessing it may be a little bland if not for these changes. I made the butternut squash and the rice in advance, which was a huge help getting ready for my dinner party. I had the dish sit in a covered container for an hour before I reheated it. The dish tasted even better after sitting for that hour. I highly recommend this dish. Plus, it's a nice vegetarian option for a dinner party.

Rating: 4
I enjoyed this recipe with the addition of 2 cloves of garlic and additional leeks (about double the amount). My recommendation: while going to the effort to roast the squash, go ahead and double that amount and use half in a soup. I made a roasted butternut squash soup with veg. stock, cream, cayenne, curry powder, and more leeks (all pureed) that went well with the wild rice dish.

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I used 2 cups of wild rice and closer to 2 cups each of onions/green onions and corn and let the squash get a little mushy. I also replaced the water with 1 cup of white wine as per earlier suggestions and omitted the parsley and the last 2 tablespoons of butter. I'm looking forward to enjoying this as a side during Thanksgiving, maybe next time with some wild mushrooms thrown in.

This was excellent! Let me put it this way, the boyfriend who made a face when I told him what I was making, after dinner and a generous helping of this rice was spooning it in his mouth from the pan with wide eyes. I too added garlic and used a dry Reisling instead of water. Thanks!

Added garlic to the leeks and white wine for the water. This is simply very delicious and I have never been a fan of wild rice! Served it at a pot luck and it was enjoyed by all. Wish I had some leftovers!!

Delicious!!! I made a few small changes: used onions instead of leeks and added some chopped garlic, used 1 cup of wild rice and 1/2 cup of long-grain brown rice, and threw in some mushrooms since I needed to use them up. I grated a little parmesan on the top, but it was just as good without. I sauteed some sliced sausage for the husband, who would consider this dish Advanced Vegetarian - and he loved it! One note, though: six cups of water is too much for the amount of rice. I ended up draining some off so the rice didn't overcook. Seriously tasty, and a fantastic mix of tastes and textures. It's interesting enough to stand alone as a main dish but would also make a fabulous side. Definitely going into the rotation!

This was a very good recipe. Wow this made enough for a crowd! Be sure to peel down to the flesh of the butternut squash. Make sure to cut the squash into smaller bite sized pieces and to roast them until very tender. It was a very nice side for Thanksgiving. Another version may be to leave out the squash all together. A very nice accompaniment to Thanksgiving turkey.

Easy & really delicious. I've made this a couple of times. Great with pork dish and also with spicy beef dish. Reheats well - make the day before & reheat.

This recipe has a permanent place in my rotation! The only thing I changed was to decrease the butter and oil drastically. 1TB of butter for the leeks, 1TB oil for the squash. Fresh corn would be amazing but it is difficult to find this time of year. The high quality organic frozen super sweet corn was perfect. Buying butternut squash already cut up would save time but I prefer to chop it myself. A tip, microwave the squash for about 2 minutes, it softens up enough to peel easier.

Rating: 3
I halved the recipe, halved again the butter, and cooked the leeks in white wine instead of water. Otherwise I made exactly as written. Like other reviewers, this recipe sounded a little plain without added spices but was quite tasty. Used up most of the remaining items from my farm share in one dish.

Rating: 4
Yum! This was wonderful, and very simple to put together. I made it as a main course and served it with Yukon Gold & Sweet Potato Gratin from this same site. The orange of the Yams and Butternut Squash, and the bright green of the Parsley made the dish really pop with color.

This is a very hearty side dish. Most in my family were not thrilled with the idea of butternut squash in this dish, but after trying it this dish is a family favorite. If you have the time, fresh corn off the cob makes the flavor even better.

Fantastic and definitely will make this again. Followed the directions on my wild rice bag so it cooked in only 25 minutes. Also roasted the butternut squash at 425 degrees for around 15-20 minutes. Did not have leeks so used everyday onions.

Yum! This recipe exceeded my expectations. Without any dominant spice included, I expected it to be more bland, but it was outstanding! Cutting up the fresh butternut squash was the most difficult part, so be sure to include your husband by handing him a big butcher knife and inviting him to get involved. I added grilled scallops with Old Bay seasoning on the side and overall it was a fabulous blend. I used all organic ingredients so this probably helped to enhance the entire meal. This recipe is a keeper!

Decent recipe. Not a spectacular dish that I'll really crave or anything... but far from bad. Like many others, I doubled the leeks and used about 2 tablespoons of butter for the entire recipe. Also threw in some grated asiago cheese. Don't be afraid to just drench this dish in salt, it really helps bring out the flavors.

I have made this four times now, it's just so delicious. There really is no need for all that butter... I use 2T and it still tastes great. I also cut the oil in half, and I add a little more salt. I have experimented with different rices, and I think nothing beats the wild rice. It gives the dish a nice nutty flavor, and the dark color makes the dish look better, too. One last note... there's no such thing as too many leeks. I double it, and then some!

We really loved this dish, with the changes I made. I was only cooking for two, so I halved everything in the recipe except for the leeks and the parsley. Reading others' reviews, I also used more salt than the recipe called for, as well as plenty of pepper. I also added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of garlic to the leeks and water mixture. I added a lot of freshly-grated parmesan cheese, about 1/2 cup, when I mixed in the rice and butternut squash. This added great flavor and texture. I will definitely make this recipe again with these modifications!

I just loved this dish, as did my guests. It burst with a savory, buttery and slightly sweet flavor and looked beautiful on the table. Because most of it can be prepared a day in advance, this was one of the easiest dishes that I made for our 13-guest holiday dinner.

Great flavors, and a fun way to combine some good fall/winter ingredients into a new dish. I, too increased the amount of leek (doubled) and it was quite good. I also made it with the Trader Joes wild rice, brown rice, and daikon seed mix. It was a bit "stickier" due to the short grain brown rice, but still very good. Served it with grilled lamb chops with balsamic/apple reduction with quince and it was fab!

A wonderful base. After reading the other reviews posted. We decided to use half wild rice and half brown rice cooked in veggie stock. Also doubled the amount of leeks used and added a dash of cayenne to wake everything up. Made this for Thanksgiving and it was enjoyed by all.

My guests seem like to this more than I did. I think part of the problem was that I did not add nearly enough leek. (It takes more than one leek to make 1½ cups.) Also, I did not use the full 6 tablespoons of butter as that seemed like a lot.

Reasonably easy to make. I did run out of time, though, so left out the corn and parsley. Still very good. It does need quite a bit of salt to raise the flavour.

After reading the recipe and reviews I was concerned that there wouldn't be enough 'flavor' with just the wild rice and veggies combined. I modified the recipe only slightly and it was EXCELLENT! I added two small crushed garlic cloves to the butter/water/leeks and kept the pan covered while steaming. I only had one small box of wild rice, so in proportion my recipe had less than called for. This amount (4 ounces dry) worked well. I used water to cook the rice (because I was sharing w/strict vegetarians and I didn't want to use chicken stock) and did not add butter at the end. I added a couple of handfuls of tiny chopped candied cranberries (Whole Foods) and about two cups toasted walnuts, chopped coarsly. The biggest change was that I cooked the butternut squash until it was completely mushy, and then when I added it in to the other ingredients it kind of made a nice binder for everything. The different textures--rice, crisp corn, walnuts, chewy cranberries-- was outstanding! I will definitely continue to play with this recipe.

Changing my review... I added some curry powder and cooked chicken to the left overs and it was delicious. I also enjoyed the curried variety cold tossed in a salad.

I tried this recipe after searching for something to use the leeks and buternut squash I had on hand. The reviews convinced me to try it, but the results were not as good as I had hoped. If I make it again I would use less butter, less salt, and cook the rice in chicken broth. I did add raisins and garlic which helped. Also one reviewer's suggestion of chutney would probably be good. It was an attractive dish, however and has promise, just lacks a little in flavor for my taste.

Rating: 4
i made this last year for turkey day and it was a repeat request for this year. I only used 1T.of butter at the very end before serving and still great! I did use low fat chicken broth to cook rice in to cover flavor of almost no fat. i also micro'd squash before peeling to make it easier to do. just 30 -40 sec. makes all the difference when you have a tough one. I also used a wild rice and brown rice blend -i just could'nt find reg.wild rice here in tiny town n.m.

Rating: 4
delicious! the squash took about 45 minutes to be fully tender, so longer than called for. i also drizzled a bit of agave nectar in the pot of squash, corn & leeks before adding the rice. definitely would make it again since it is almost a meal in itself for a vegetarian.

Made for a potluck dinner and it was a big hit and low stress (cooked the rice and squash ahead and finished right before we left). I used Lundberg's Wild Blend and added cranberries and pecans. I also substituted dry white wine for the water when I cooked the leeks. Even tastier leftover!

I agree--a few pats of butter are a necessary indulgence to finish this dish--it does make a difference. Also, I thought it needed more salt overall. We used fresh corn and added some nutmeg and chopped pecans at the last minute. This is a total "go-to" recipe for me!!!!

Yum! This recipe was a huge hit -- so delicious and now one of my new favorites. Wild rice often takes longer than 45 minutes to cook, just to keep in mind. I used maybe 1 tablespoon of butter, it doesn't need any more than that (and a way to make it healthier).

Really tasty and healthy. I just sauteed some shallots in a little olive oil and then addded the corn, rice and squash and a little water. Also added some kale, chard and fresh sage. Great fall dish. I'm sure it's good with the butter, but it's good without, too.

This is a wonderful dish for Thanksgiving dinner. One of the terrific things about it is that it will serve as a delicious vegan main course for the meal, as well as a side dish for the turkey-eaters. We have vegans and die-hard carnivores at our family table and I like to make dishes that everyone will enjoy (except for the turkey) and this recipe fits the bill perfectly if you omit the butter and use more olive oil as I did. Other than that, I don't think any changes to the recipe are needed. It tastes good and looks beautiful on the plate.

I made this dish more or less following the recipe except I used Lundberg's Wild Blend of Rice and toasted walnuts. After I put it all together I did think it needed a little jump so I added 3-4 T of Major Gray's Mango Chutney and the juice of 2 lemons. Really 5 FORKS!!!

As recommended, I made the wild rice, roasted the squash, and boiled the corn and cut off the cob the evening before. Used all organic ingredients and they were wonderful on their own. For some reason, when I put them all together -- following the recipe exactly -- there seemed to be something missing. I hadn't yet added the last 2 pats of butter because thought it would make it too heavy, and I was trying to save on the fat content. Finally, I squeezed about one-half of a meyer lemon over the dish, and that did the trick! It added a brightness and pulled it all together very nicely. Delicious!

Fantastic. Like others, I used a little less butter (4tbsp) and next time I'll try to cut it down even more. I didn't have corn on hand, so I omitted it. Didn't miss it one bit. I added some toasted chopped walnuts at the very end for texture and protein, and I think it made the dish! Try it.

The original recipe was okay; I modified it a bit to suit my tastebuds... instead of leeks and corn, I caramelized some shallots, minced garlic, and a bunch of ribboned lacinato kale. Topped it off with some queso fresco and some extra parsley. It's fabulous! I'm a vegetarian, but for non-veggies I could see adding some slab bacon or hamhock for some extra flava flav.

Yum! What a great recipe! I made it with onions instead of leeks and it was great, though probably not as colorful. I think spinach would be a good addition as well.

I loved this dish. I didn't add the extra butter at the end and it absolutely didn't need it. I thought it was a creative use of the ingredients and the results were delicious and colorful. It's hard to find original side dishes, and this totally fit the bill. I'd make it again (and again).

i like this recipe, but it's not everything i was hoping for. it's a great side dish (note: i only used a bit of butter at the end, and used a bit of olive oil at the beginning), but somewhat laborious for a side dish, i think...having to roast the butternut squash ahead of time and all. i'd probably make it again, though i'd rather use by butternut squash, leeks, and corn on separate recipes.

I am not a big butternut squash fan but with the holidays coming I was looking for something other than smashed butternut with brown sugar...This was simply amazing! Easy to put together. I was short on time so I used leftover Uncle Ben's wild rice, from the night before. I too cut back on butter...2T and a 1T of olive oil and a bit of crushed garlic and instead of adding water I added 1/2 c of white wine (less liquid than the recipe called for because I used leftover rice). FANTASTIC and beautifully colorful for a fall table!

The flavors in this were incredible! I made lots of changes however (I combined this with another similar recipe that uses pumpkin). I omitted the butter and used only olive oil. I didn't have leeks, so I cut up one sweet vidalia onion. I tossed the squash and onion pieces in a large bowl with 3 tbs. olive oil, 1/4 tsp salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. I roasted them in the oven at 350 for 20 min and then raised the heat to 400 for another 15. After raising the heat, I added 1/2 can sweet corn so that it could roast along with the other veggies. I served over wild rice with 3 tbs. toasted sunflower seeds. I poured a citrus vinagrette dressing over that I made with 2 tbs. olive oil, 2 tbs. fresh lemon juice, orange zest, 1 tbs. honey, and 1 tsp. chopped fresh mint. It really is much easier to prepare than it sounds...I was able to do it in a dorm kitchen.

This was delicious. The time consuming part was cooking the rice and butternut squash, but in a rush you can speed up the process by purchasing the fully cooked wild rice from Trader Joes.

Very good and easy to prepare. Really nice flavors. I used a whole sugar pumpkin instead of butternut squash. I think any winter squash would work in this recipe. I thought about using curry powder as suggested by another reviewer, but I'm all out. The flavors were excellent without it, and I think curry might compete too much, so wouldn't use it next time. I used about half the butter called for with great results. Thanks to other reviewers for that suggestion. I hate peeling squash. Does anyone have any good tips about how to make it less of a royal pain?
