This was fantastic. Since I can't help myself, I had to tweak it and substituted 1/2 c. of broth with good white wine and doubled the mushrooms. Great!! I'll try this with veg. broth for my vegetarian friends.

This is my go to recipe for vegetarian company. It is delicious and the wild mushrooms and truffle oil make it special for a dinner party. It needs only a festive seasonal salad, a roll and lovely red wine....maybe some soft jazz in the bacground.

Great basic recipe for mushroom risotto - used a combination of fresh cremini and dried morels. I used the water from reconsituting these instead of the plain water as called for in the recipe. Served with some grilled chicken and steamed asparagus. Though not a huge fan of Bourdain, would definitely make again . . .

This is my favorite risotto recipe. It's simple and I usually have the ingredients on hand. Using a good quality parmesan is essential. I use a mixture of whatever fresh mushrooms I have on hand and dried porcinis, which I reconstitute, then add the mushroom soaking water to the broth. It gives it that much more depth of flavor. I haven't tried it with truffle oil yet, but it's delicious without it!

This risotto was delicious, but it was the chanterelles that really made it. I only had about 5oz of fresh chanterelles, which isn't much when preparing a meal for 3 people. I was excited that this recipe called only for 1/4lb mushrooms (if you look at the other recipes for mushroom risotto, they usually call for a pound or so), but I was worried that it wouldn't be enough to really flavor the risotto. However, chanterelles are amazingly flavorful--the risotto had a wonderful wild-mushroom flavor even with such a small amount. I didn't use any truffle oil, because I didn't want to overpower the chanterelles, and honestly no one at the table thought it was lacking. I would only use truffle oil if you're making the risotto with dried mushrooms or relatively flavorless mushrooms like cremini, but if you have real, wild, fresh mushrooms I wouldn't add anything to mask their flavor. (If you're using less flavorful mushrooms, I would also add significantly more mushrooms than this recipe calls for.) I made a couple other additions: like other reviewers I used wine for my first cup of liquid, and then I also added some sugar snap peas (steamed them for 4 minutes, then cut them into 1/2-inch pieces and added them with the mushrooms in the last minutes of cooking). The sugar snap peas added both flavor and texture to the risotto. All in all, it was a wonderful summer dish!

Nice risotto recipe. Be careful of adding too much salt - I'm used to risotto turning out bland so I added a healthy amt of salt to the mushrooms and it became too much. Easy to make and very tasty!

Excellent! I couldn't find fresh mushrooms, used reconstituted porcinis. It worked beautifully.

The beauty of risotto is its simplicity. Tony Bourdain would kick some *ss if he saw anyone add fat free cream to his recipe. Sometimes there are so many additions and changes to recipes here that they barely resemble the original recipe. This is excellent as written.

Tasty risotto recipe and my first try at homemade. Replaced 1/2 to 3/4 cups broth with a dry white wine. Also added some parsley (didn't have chives) along with the cheese and mushrooms. Will be even better next time when I have some truffle oil.

Have been making this since 1999. Excellent. I add a bit more cheese and truffle oil. Yum!

I lucked upon some fresh chanterelles (rare here) and this was the recipe I used to serve them: moan-out-loud good! I changed nothing. I think it was the truffle oil that took it over the top. Scrumptious!

Rating: 4
Wow! This was amazing! I made a few minor changes/additions and it turned out to be fantastic. First, I used about 1/2 bottle of white wine as the first liquid (absorbed by the rice). I also added a healthy splash of fat free half and half and substituted veggie stock. Most importantly, I used two different truffle products. One was this truffle cream/paste and the other was white truffle oil (I got both online and they were cheap). I have my own spice garden, so I threw in a bunch of fresh rosemary too for some added flavor. I also added roasted butternut squash at the end for some color, sweetness and to break up the monotony of the risotto. On top of each serving, I grated some emmental and added toasted and chopped walnuts. OMG...this really tasted like restaurant food at it's best. I served it on top of fresh spinach. Personally, I think it needs some fresh greens because risotto is too boring to the mouth to eat that much of it.

Loved this recipe. I used fresh morels and fresh porcinis. I even did truffle shavings on top of drizzling a little truffle oil; I didn't find it overpowering. I threw in some fresh asparagus that I had. The only thing that I would change, is adding a little white wine at the beginning of the process; I did miss the wine flavor.

I made this dish as written and it turned out beautifully. I did cook the risotto considerably longer than the 18 minutes stated in the recipe. It took me approx. 35 minutes to get the rice to a nice al dente stage. At 18-20 minutes, the rice was still crunchy. If you can get truffle oil, it's worth it. The truffle oil kicked it up to 4 forks for me. I drizzled just a touch on each serving instead of mixing it in to the rice. I also served it with extra Parmigiano-Reggiano. Delicious!!

Wow! What a risotto! This in now my favorite risotto recipe. I used portabella mushrooms instead, halved the butter and doubled the truffle oil and skipped the chives. The truffle oil is a must- definitely not optional. Anthony Bourdain- I love you!

Great recipe! Used the following substitutions: beef stock instead of chicken, oyster mushrooms and portabellos, no truffle oil, and gruyere instead of parmigiano. The gruyere substitute was exquisite, the risotto itself was creamy even before I added the cheese. Served it with filet mignon for my anniversary, huge hit!

This was excellent. I can't get these mushrooms so used shitakes and oyster instead. I also added several large handfulls of baby spinach at the end, just tossed it through with the mushrooms and let the heat of the rice cook it. This was a fabulous addition health wise, taste wise and appearance wise.

Love risotto and this is one of my new favorite recipes! Made according to recipe except with slightly more fresh chanterelles ( so good!)and an extra tsp of chopped chives. Excellent recipe!

Made exactly as written, using mostly shitake and some crimini mushrooms (only fresh selection currently available)...used the full tsp. of white truffle oil and good quality cheese. It did take a little longer to cook to the correct consistency than the recipe stated. Absolutely wonderful - as good as what I paid $16 for at a highly rated Vancouver restaurant. Definitely will add to the repertoire and worth experimenting with different mushrooms when they are in season.

Great recipe--guests raved. Using a variety of wild mushrooms is necessary--I tried it once with some baby bellas that I had on hand, and it was not good. Also, truffle oil adds significantly to the flavor of the dish, so don't skip it! For the person asking where to find it, I got some at Whole Foods.

I made this with chanterelles and the truffle oil. It took significantly longer than the recipe suggested to reach the appropriate doneness of the rice (closer to 25 minutes), but the really awful part is the amount of truffle oil it calls for. With just the half-teaspoon, the recipe took on a nauseatingly strong fake-truffle odor and taste. I can't even imagine using the full teaspoon. Even before adding the truffle oil, it was nothing celestial, and certainly not worth the labor that goes into making risotto. Skip the truffle oil, restore the shaved black truffles if you wish, and maybe it would be worthwhile.

My husband made this tonight for dinner. He followed the directions exactly except for subbing in black truffle oil in place of the white truffle oil. It turned out great! We will definitely make this again with whatever wild mushrooms we can find at the market/store.

Excellent flavor. Made according to recipe with one exception. I was making to go with Osso Bucco. Cleaned the veal from bones in advance and made about two cups of veal stock. In addition, I found a mushroom broth at the store and used that with the veal broth instead of chicken stock. It was very mushroomy, very creamy and I got rave reviews.

I only rated this recipe with three forks because while it was good, it wasn't 'beyond compare'. I used dried morels, because that's what I had. I didn't rehydrate them, but chopped them finely (a heaping tablespoon) and fried them in the butter/olive oil step. Then I added them bit by bit with the stock. I also didn't have any truffle oil or chives. The chives would have added a nice touch

This is one of my DH's favorites; am making tonight on special request. The truffle oil is a must, and I usually use beef broth instead of chicken, as it gives a richer flavor. (found by accident once after realizing I'd no chicken broth in the house). I'm a risotto lover and this is my favorite recipe.

I used pearl couscous instead of rice, and I used chanterelles and blue foot mushrooms. It was delicious and received rave reviews from its consumers. A plus-plus.

I tweaked the recipe according to my taster and the availability of ingredients. I used reconstituted dried porcinis (use broth to reconstitute and then reserve liquid) and also fresh white mushrooms and also shitakes. Do not omit the truffle oil. Also, taking a cue from another recipe I added 1/4 cup light cream just before the risotto was done. I did not use the chives but I can't imagine the risotto being any better. A little goes a looong way--even for a confirmed meat eater like my husband. I served with a simple salad and some bread. Out of this world, truly. If you set up all of your ingredients (mise en place) then the recipe also doesn't seem as labor intensive. Go for it!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I did make some changes: I simmered porcini mushrooms for approx 5 minutes and used this stock in addition to the chicken stock which gave the risotto a wonderful flavor. I also used whole grain rice which was tasty but very time consuming. It took 60-70 minutes to prepare but it was well worth it.

I disagree with those reviewers who said this dish lacks flavor. We are big risotto eaters in our family, and I found this recipe a wonderful, delicate version of mushroom risotto. It could pair with almost anything. The white truffle oil (we drizzle it on top instead of mixing it in) makes it fabulous!

Very good, but since most of my family doesn't like wild mushrooms - I don't know how often I could make it.

This risotto is perfect with the osso buco recipe. If I were having risotto by itself or with some simple dish like steamed vegetables, then I would like this to be a bit more flavorful. As it is, it provides a great balance to the richness of the osso buco. And I do think the porcini and truffle oil make a difference. I just happened to have both on hand from our trip to Italy last year, and I was grateful for the chance to use them again! The white truffle oil is just this side of heaven. Adds just the necessary dimension to the dish. YUM!

This risotto is good but has a very simple and subtle flavor. I tend to prefer more flavorful risottos like the RED WINE AND MUSHROOM RISOTTO on this website. (Note: I didn't add the truffel oil which I imagine would have been wonderful.)

2 caveats: 1)I didn't have the truffle oil. 2)I used oyster mushrooms. It was my first time using them, and I think maybe they weren't quite the right kind of mushroom for this recipe, which cooked them down to a tiny pile of flavorless bits. That said, I still don't think I'll bother with this recipe again. Risotto is one of those dishes that you want to be worth all the hard work and sweat, and even with the right kind of mushies I don't think this recipe had enough background flavor to really be worth it. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right. Try it if you're adventurous and confident, you'll definitely end up with something edible, but stirrer beware! It might be disappointing!

This risotto was excellent! It was very creamy and had so much flavor. I used a dried wild mushroom packet from Trader Joe's, and it was delicious and really gave us a variety of mushrooms that we wouldn't have found fresh. I didn't have the truffle oil, but it was still excellent. I paired it with Pan Fried Steaks with Gorgonzola Butter (from this site), and it was excellent together!

Very good risotto. I used what looked like baby bellos (I live in Sweden, couldn't translate the word and forgot to ask my husband) and portobellos because I couldn't find any wild ones. I used my homemade reduced chicken stock. I tasted before the truffle oil and after. Huge difference. Don't skip the truffle oil! My husband loved the dish, but we both thought it would have been much richer and more flavorful with wild mushrooms and veal stock or demi-glace. Served with veal osso buco.

To the Cook from Salem SC: This is a good way to cook rice, but unless you are using Arborio or other Italian risotto rice, it is NOT risotto. Not even close. In the classic risotto recipe, the first half cup of liquid added to the rice is usually a dry white wine. I use vermouth, and I add a few tablespoons of cream with the cheese.
