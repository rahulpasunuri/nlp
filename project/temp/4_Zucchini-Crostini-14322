I made these for my daughter's baby shower last weekend...they were a huge hit. I will definitely make them again.

This was excellent. I melted the cheese on top of the bread before adding the zucchini mix and it was easier to assemble that way.

I made these this weekend, and they went over really well with the crowd. They are very easy to make which is always a plus in my book.

I liked this recipe, but I think it needs something else, maybe I will try adding some mushrooms.

My husband and I both LOVED this! We've been to Italy and this is the BEST crostini we've ever eaten. Only embellishment on the recipe: we added brushed on olive oil. It is so TASTY! Perfect with just a salad.

I liked this recipe alot, made it for a dinner party and a few people asked for the recipe. I did find the bread was a little bland when prepared per the recipe. I gave it more flavor by brushing olive oil on before toasting, and then after it cooled rubbed a cut clove of garlic over the bread.

I loved this!! It's a gardener's dream!! I used zucchini, yellow squash and roma tomatoes from my garden, as well as fresh thyme. I also added lots of salt and pepper, to spice it up a bit. I made it twice last weekend for BBQ's and it was a hit!!

A wonderful, light recipe. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and will try the other reviewer's idea of adding mushrooms and olives next time.

I am very surprised about all the glorious reviews for this one. The result doesn't justify the effort, in my opinion. It's just like ratatouille put on toast. It tasted alright, but was nothing to write home about.

we really liked this one. deceptive because the ingredients are kind of basic looking... but once put together, i had a hard time keeping myself from picking at it before the guests arrived. and, as other cooks have said, the basic recipe is a great starting point for variations. i think i'm going to make it again today!

This recipie is amazing! It is so versatile, the flavours are incredible and it is so easy!! I have made this many times and added different things like mushrooms and/or chicken~ (I recommend chicken).. Eat it as stated, with melted cheese on toasted bread or also plain (adding cheese is wonderful) in a bowl. Over pasta would be great too! Cold or hot, this is one of the best~ It is healthy, simple and fresh-tasting!!!

I peeled the zucchini, as the recipe did not mention either way. What way is it supposed to be? Maybe the texture would be even better if the peel was left on.

I made two appetizers for a recent dinner party-- Zucchini Crostini and the West Indian Bean dip. While guest said they loved the dip and wanted the recipe they devoured this. Interesting...... I'm going to a pot luck this evening and will try it with canned chopped tomatoes instead of doing all the work to peel and de-seed. Next month I'm doing another dinner party and considering eliminating the tomatoes entirely and add mushrooms and olives. Just a thought.

I loved these yuummy, fast & easy, grown up melted cheese sandwiches. They were so good, I would serve them as a main course with salad. Next time I'll add some olives, and maybe use less oil.
