I like the concept but this recipe is gross. I tried it exactly as written and threw the whole thing away. I tried it a second time using the Nestle recipe on the chocolate chip bag and they were delish! Don't cook too long (even if the center is still underdone) as they harden a bit once removed from the cooker. Great if you like a soft cookie with a scoop of ice cream on top!

I'm a relatively new slow cooker user and I have to say I'm baffled. Why on earth would anyone make cookies in a slow cooker? In less than an hour, you can make freshly baked cookies in the oven. I thought slow cookers were meant for having dinner ready when you get home from work!

This was the most absolute horrible experience. A total waste of time and ingredients.Reccommend to remove this disaster, as a totally un-funnie joke!

Although you can make chocolate chip cookies in a slow cooker, I would not toss out my cookie sheets quite yet. I made these as directed, but by the time I went to tilt the cover, they were already quite burned. Perhaps there is too much butter, and not enough sugar, as they are not sweet. A waste of time, ingredients, and effort. Back to the regular method!

Yes, you can make chocolate chip cookies in a slow cooker, but do not throw away your cookie sheets just yet. I set the cooker and left it for 2 1/2 hours, thinking I would tilt off the cover at that time as directed. Instead, the giant lump smelled and was burned. I turned off the cooker and removed the insert. When the cookie emerged, it had a 1/2 inch think burned crust, and the remaining parts were not tasty. Perhaps there is too much butter, or not enough sugar, but this is not worth the time, ingredients, and effort. Regular way is best!

Didn't read the other review until after I had made the cookie, mistakenly using only 1/2 cup butter instead of the called for 1 cup. Sounds like it was a good mistake. Was worried they would turn out dry when I realized what I had done, but it actually turned out pretty well...similar texture to a brownie but tasting like a chocolate chip cookie! Would be really good with a scoop of ice cream on top. I would think 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup butter is plenty .

Didn't read the other review until after I tried the recipe...mistakenly using only 1/2 cup butter instead of the called for 1 cup. Was a bit worried they would turn out dry and crumbly, but didn't work out too bad, much like a brownie actually. Would be really good with a scoop of ice cream on top. I think 1/2 cup to 3/4 cup butter would be plenty.

I was intrigued at the idea of making cookies in the crock pot, since I live in a hot climate and hate to turn on the oven in the summer. No one had previously reviewed this recipe, so I knew I was on my own. Guess what - totally disgusting. I followed the recipe to a T, and was sorely disappointed. The ratio of butter to dry ingredients is quite high, double what is called for in a typical "toll house" cookie recipe, and the end result was predictably oily. Oil actually pooled on top of the "cookie" while it was in the crock pot. Gross. The excess oil also created a nasty crust on the sides and bottom of the cookie. It was absolutely inedible (which is saying a lot, as I can usually stomach anything with chocolate chips in it)!
