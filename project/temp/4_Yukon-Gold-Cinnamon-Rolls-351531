This has become THE Christmas staple for my entire family (and some of my friends). While it is a bit of work, the rolls are tender, HUGE, and delicious. Like many others I would recommend serving with a cream cheese icing rather than the glaze outlined in the recipe. In my family, we also use a bit more filling (probably around 50% more) than the recipe calls for but it makes them extra gooey and delicious. Cannot recommend these highly enough. They truly are worth every ounce of work that goes into them!

I don't like having to change a recipe but will if it means that I will be able to execute it at all. I had to add additional flour to the recipe but as little as possible. I have not purchased bread in over 2 years and noticed right off that only 2/3 of the yeast reqs were necessary any more is overkill. The potato portion was touch and go but won't be a problem after the first time. I absolutely loved how well the cinnamon rolls rose. The crumb and texture were far superior than any that I have ever made. The main issue with mine which I noticed upon reading the recipe but had to slap my hand before I could remedy it was the sugar amount for the dough. The portion added was enough for the yeast but aside from that there was literally nothing contributing to the flavor of the rolls. I was hoping that icing/frosting/glaze could carry them. I am definitely making these again but will add a half cup of sugar and will adjust in the future. Summary, more flour, more sugar, less yeast.

This could have been a great recipe, but changes were needed! First of all, I allowed my potatoes to boil uncovered and ALL of the water had evaporated by the time they were tender, so after adding the butter, I added a cup of milk to achieve the right liquid to flour ratio (and because milk makes a nicer dough than water alone). Secondly, the yeast was overkill. I make all of our bread products so I knew it was too much and decreased the amount to 4 1/2 tsp (about two packets if you use those) and the rolls were still very yeasty when finished. For the filling, I omitted 1/2c. of the sugar and it was just sweet enough for my taste BUT I found that melting the mixture just enough to spread with a spatula was very convenient, as opposed to trying to sprinkle it evenly. For the frosting I used my orange scented cream cheese frosting recipe that I use for all my cinnamon rolls :) The final product was good, albeit yeasty. I'll be making them again with a few more changes!

I'm not going to lie, this recipe was a bit of a pain in the rear. I doubled it to make enough for my coworkers. I agree wholeheartedly that the flour amount listed is not enough. For a double recipe I used an entire 5lb bag of flour. Instead of crumbling the filling, I did spread it for an even distribution of filling. With the first round of baking I baked on a sheet pan, spaced apart, as directed. Big mistake, the sugar spilled over in my oven and the cinnamon rolls began unraveling. For the second round of baking, I baked in 14in round cake pans with the rolls touching, this created desirable soft outer layers and no further mess in my oven, lesson learned. I used the cream cheese icing recipe (doubled) from the Cinnamon Rolls with Cream Cheese Glaze Bon Appetit March 2008. They were devoured and coworkers are still asking when I will be making more. They taste was so superior and out of this world that they totally outweighed the troubles and warranted a 4 fork rating.

Perfection! These are the lightest, most moist cinnamon rolls I've ever made. I followed the recipe closely, used King Arthur bread flour, boiled the potatoes with the lid off on med-high and used about 3/4 C. extra flour during kneading. My only caution is that the recipe for the filling results in a too moist crumb: I would add another 2-3 T, of four to make it easier to spread/crumble onto the dough. I made 12 large rolls in a standard half-sheet pan. As was suggested by others, I used orange-flavored cream cheese frosting. Excellent in every way!

I made these last week after seeing the recipe when I made the Chicken thighs with Yukon gold potatoes & carrots (also yummy)! They were excellent. I made sure to boil the potatoes at a rolling boil, so much of the water evaporated away. I used 3 cups of whole wheat flour in my usual quest to impart some redeeming nutritional value into an otherwise unhealthy treat. The result is delicious. 1/2 of the rolls are still in the freezer to be doled out judiciously. I used the glaze in the recipe & it was a terrific combo.

Oh, and other reviewers said, I ended up added extra flour to make the dough dry enough.

These are great, I make them for family for breakfast every New Year's Day. Only problem is that they always seem to stick and burn on the bottom as the cinnamon filling melts and runs out. Haven't found a way to prevent this, so I just slice off the bottoms after they're done. I replace the glaze in the recipe with an orange cream cheese icing--much better.

This was my first attempt at making cinnamon rolls, and I was not disappointed. Scrumptious! I, too, added quite a bit more flour, even though I boiled the potatoes with the lid off. I ended up with 24 large rolls. My only regret is that I was without parchment paper. I baked the rolls on a lightly oiled baking sheet. After baking then cooling for 10 minutes, the first batch stuck to the sheet. The melted filling had hardened and cemented the rolls in place. I took the next batch off of the sheet right away; that prevented the sticking, but resulted in some of the filling escaping the rolls. I will definitely use parchment paper next time.

I'm not a baker or a cinnamon bun aficionado but these buns are pretty amazing. They are time consuming and I like to imagine this recipe is building me up, to break me down, only to build me back up again. Is it me or does this dough seem like it has a mind of its own? If you can tame the beast, which I managed to with a suped up KitchenAid you and whoever you serve them to will be very, very happy. I also second the recommendation of boiling the potatoes without a lid. I still had to add a lot more flour to the mixture but it would have been a lot more had I not boiled lidless.

Recipe worked very well. I made the dough the day before, but rolled out the dough and put on the filling the day I baked them. The only change I made was to make a simpler glaze...just a little confectioner's sugar and milk. The rolls got rave reviews. I liked the way the potatoes worked into the dough very easily.

LOVE these rolls. The potato makes ALL the difference. I have made them for Christmas morning every year for the past 3 years. An interesting addition to the filling would be ground cloves. My borther-in-law suggested it last year and it worked a treat.

Rating: 4
As many others suggested, the key to this recipe is boiling the potatoes (uncovered) at high heat until only 1/3 c-1/2 c. of water remains (also making sure the potatoes are very soft). I used 2 packages of yeast-be sure to use a very large bowl as the dough expands considerably during first rise! I used about 1 cup+ of extra flour while kneading (the dough will still be somewhat sticky). These are HUGE rolls (fills a sheet pan), so next time I will divide dough in two and make 24 "regular sized" rolls (or make half recipe!). One thing that worked well was making the rolls the day before (up to putting them in the oven), covering loosely with plastic wrap and letting them rise in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, take them out while oven is preheating, then cook as usual. Really a fabulous cinnamon roll recipe. Enjoyed the frosting as well.

Rating: 3
I also had a huge problem with too much liquid and ended up adding many extra cups of flour - probably negating much of the impact of the potato and diluting the sugar and salt. (I think my mistake was that I covered the potatoes as they cooked - not letting all the liquid evaporate off.) However, they were still delish - and now I have a batch of dough in the freezer for another time. I made a cream cheese glaze instead. I look forward to trying these again.

This was my first real attempt at baking, and I royally managed to mess up several key steps. I must say, they were still amazing (don't tell my Grammy I said that!)I only used 2 yeast packages as a couple reviews suggested & I couldn't find Yukon Golds either so I used Russets. Works perfect. Also, I made the creamcheese frosting as suggested & I highly recommend this. I will absolutely be making these again (correctly).

Delicious!! I left the potatoes on high as another reviewer suggested, and actually boiled away almost all the liquid and ended up adding about 1/2 cup while mashing. During kneading, I added about 3/4 cup extra flour. I ended up with 16 rolls, and the amount of filling was just fine. Added about 1 cup of raisins, and cream cheese icing instead of the glaze (8 oz cream cheese softened, 1/2 cup butter, 1 cup icing sugar, 1 tsp vanilla). Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and they have been a big hit! Next time I may split the dough in two and roll out separately to make smaller rolls.

Just made these, yummy!! I used only 2 pkgs. , also I used my dough hook on the stand mixer, adding about a 1 to 1 1/2 cups more flour than called for in recipe. These are very tender & moist! I will definetly be doing these again.

These cinnamon rolls are the BEST! I've made this recipe 4 times already and each time it's been sinfully yummy. I was able to follow the recipe pretty closely and not have to adjust much. It seems the biggest variable (based on everyone's comment)is how the potatoes come out. While you boil the potatoes (I used Russet also), adjust your water as needed so that you will have about a 1/3 cup or so of liquid afterwards. If you have too much, take some of it out before you mash. If gets low, add more while it's boiling. One more key point: be patient - let your dough rise! I let my last batch rise longer, and it made a big difference. My rolls were fluffier and gigantic! This is definitely one of my favorite recipes!

Rating: 4
These are the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had. I was not able to find Yukon Gold potatoes, so I used Russets instead, and the rolls were still delicious. After reading several reviews, I used 2 packets of yeast instead of 3. The dough was very sticky so I did use more flour, like the recipe says. I probably added around 1 cup of flour. I baked half of the recipe the first week of November, froze half of the dough, and then baked the other half for Christmas. The frozen dough rolled out just as nicely as it did the first time. For the Christmas batch I made miniature rolls (half the width and height of the original recipe). Although they were still very good, because I rolled the dough much thinner, the rolls were not as flaky/chewy as the first batch.

Rating: 1
This whole recipe needs work. I used every proportion called for and the dough was so moist that I needed to add three additional cups of flour and should have added another one. With the additional flour, the yield popped up to 12 additional rolls and then of course the filling and the glaze needed to be doubled. But here's the surprise--the rolls were still very good and my family loved them--they didn't look great, but I did the best I could. I will make this recipe again--because I enjoy a challenge and it has potential. I think initially I need to use one less potato and possibly one less packet of yeast. Mashed potato added to bread recipes really does makes them so soft and moist.

I liked the dough and glaze. I will make it again but I would double the filling. Regarding the dough, after I cooked the potatoes I put all the ingredients in my bread machine and added 1-2 cups of additional flour. Next time I would omit 1/2 of water in the potatoes.

These were allot of work but worth it. I had to add extra flour to account for the very sticky dough. I also added chopped pecans to the filling and used a couple of tablespoons of Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur) instead of vanilla extract in the glaze. That little bit of hazelnut flavor made a nice touch.

Overall nice flavor and texture. I needed about 1-1 1/2 cups of extra flour, and it made 2 dozen good sized rolls.

I loved this recipe! I didn't have trouble with my potatoes--you just have to boil them on high for almost 20 minutes, so that all you have left in the pot is at most 1/3 cup of very cloudy, starchy liquid. When it comes to the yeast, I used about 2/3 of the yeast asked for and the dough had no trouble rising plenty. Be patient with the dough; even though mine was not too sticky, it needs to be kneaded a lot before it comes together. Just hang in there! I added raisins and grated apple too; the raisins were great, though I'd have to add more than the two apples I did for the apples to really be tasted. I ended up with tender, light, moist, huge cinnamon rolls, with just the right amount of sugar/cinnamon goop. I did make more than twelve, but I'm a college student, so I have plenty of people around happy and eager to help me with them. Best cinnamon rolls I've made.

Rating: 0
Given the amount of salt, sugar, and yeast in the dough I would recommend punching it down at least twice as often as the recipe to ensure the dough does not overflow its vessel. Directions on potatoes and water are excessively vague. The amount of water left over is going to vary considerably between different potatoes and pans. Dough was almost impossible to roll and would not hold its shape when rolled up when I tried it the first time probably due to excess water in the dough. I personally prefer rolls with an excess of cinnamon and butter in the filling. Would recommend using 1.5X the amount of butter in the filling and 2x the amount of cinnamon. Add extra brown sugar to offset bitterness of extra cinnamon, about 1.5x or to taste. Definitely taste the filling first to make sure it's perfect for your palate. Following the directions explicitly I'd give the recipe 1 fork simply due to the difficulty required in making it work the first time without tweaks. After adjusting for a more consistent result and based on the flavor and texture of the finish product I'd say 4 forks.

Rating: 1
Boy what a disaster. I had to add twice the amount of flour to get the dough to an elastic state. There was just too much moisture. Then I let it rise, when I went to check on it the dough had oozed out the bowl and down the sides! I think the 2 tablespoons of yeast was too much. I had previously tried another recipe on this site, will go back to that one....

Amazing! The best cinnamon rolls I've ever made. I rolled them out (haha) on Easter, and by accidentally misreading the recipe, used only 1/3rd the yeast called for, and they were still amazing. Next time, I would use a bit more, but not the full amount of yeast called for. I doubled the recipe, made the dough (with lots of extra flour as commented) and rolled out, placed onto cookie sheets, then covered and refrigerated overnight. In the morning I let rise another hour or so on the counter, then baked and iced and it made the morning easy and the cinnamon rolls turned out gorgeously. I will make these again for sure, but I will either have to have some extra time on my hands, a huge craving for cinnamon rolls, a special occasion, or all of the above.

I thought these were incredible. I was also worried after reading some of the reviews, but I didn't have any trouble. When the potatoes were done, there was only about 1/3 of a cup of liquid left with them, and after mashing them with the butter, eggs and flour, it had the consistency of nice creamy mashed potatoes. The dough looked very sticky after mixing in the 3 cups of flour, so I added about 1/2 cup extra just to get it to bind up a little better before throwing it onto my counter to knead. Between the flour on the counter and on my hands, it really didn't stick at all! The buns themselves came out moist and chewy, just the way I like them. Perfect!

I just made these and they were amazing. I looked at the previous reviews and was hesitant about it at first because so many people seemed to have problems with it, the water with the potatos, the flour, etc..but I followed the recipe as closely as I could and they came out perfectly. The only tips that I would point out is that they said to have the potatos cut into 2-inch pieces, make sure to do that because it will give them a longer cooking time to boil off a bit more water, and boil them, not simmer. Also when it comes to the flour you will need to knead more flour in as you go but the dough will be sticky when you are done, it is a sweet dough and they tend to be sticky. You will get a fabulous cinnamon roll!

Rating: 3
There's no question about the superiority of this recipe when it comes to how moist they are. Unbelievable!! But like many other reviewers, I had the problem of needing considerably more flour than called for. About 6 cups, maybe. I suspect this is because the recipe doesn't specify whether we are to boil the potatoes with a roiling boil or a soft boil. Depending on how much water boils off, that will determine how much more flour you'll have to add or not add. The recipe could do with a but more specificity about how much water aim at being left in the pan. In addition, I would add about a quarter cup more sugar to the dough while mixing it. The other cinnamon roll recipe on Epicurious calls for about a 1/2 cup sugar, and it makes less dough than this one. This recipe came out bland as far as the taste of the roll goes. More sugar, and a little more salt would do it. Due to the extra flour I had to add, my batch came out HUGE. I could make twice as many giant rolls as the recipe estimated, even slicing them very wide!! In the future, I will make this recipe with the much needed adjustments I mentioned, and probably half it when I do. I will probably boil the potatoes at a stronger boil so as to evaporate a little more water off.

Too funny, I actually had to add more water to my potatoes to get them to cook all the way without all the water boiling out. The recipe does say a LARGE pot. The dough came together for me exactly how stated in the recipe...very nice. I am going to try to wrap and freeze the jelly roll after the second rise because I am making the rolls for brunch in a few days.

These were fantastic! The potato really helps lighten up the dough, making them very fluffy. I agree and would add more of the filling in but be sure to have a catch tray or pan with sides, the filling leaked out and burned the bottom of the oven!

I really can't say that I am an unexperienced cook and baker, but this recipe caught me on the wrong foot. Even though I read the previous reviews I needed to add at least two more cups of flour. I also used "fresh" yeast as I am not used to working with dried yeast. The result however was great and everyone loved the rolls. By the way, instead of 12 I made 48 rolls out of the same amount of dough.

I drained the potatoes before mashing and still had to add some extra flour to make the dough workable. I thought the final product was good, but not as moist as I'd hoped. Perhaps because of the extra flour I had to add. I made the dough the night before and after letting it rise, I wrapped it tightly in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge until the morning. That worked just fine and saved me a lot of prep time in the morning.

The whole family enjoyed these rolls. I am glad that I read the other reviews first because I did use at least two extra cups of flour. I only had two packages of yeast and I found that to be plenty, I can't imagine using the three called for in the recipe. Next time I will probably divide the dough in two pieces to roll out, as there was a lot of it and the rolls were huge. Otherwise, very tasty and worth trying.

this was a total waste of time and ingredients. The dough was way too sticky and impossible to knead. I had to add a lot more flour and after the first rise it was difficult to roll and the rolls did not double in volume the second time. The filling was tasty but the roll itself did not have a good flavor.

Most importantly, clean your kitchen AFTER you make this recipe... Flour...everywhere... ...But it's okay, because these are quite good. I found the liquid to be the perfect amount, and I boiled it for exactly 8 minutes on medium-high ("7" on my stovetop). I think using the immersion (stick/hand) blender helped tremendously -- there were no lumps (the potato was essentially pureed!), and the liquid absorbed nicely into the potato puree. After mixing, the dough was sticky and soft, but not to the point where it was a problem; it was much like making bread by hand: add flour where necessary to achieve the desired texture. By the time it was properly kneaded and ready for rising, it felt like a warm, happy puppy. The first rise made for a fluffy and velvety batch of dough, which, with the generous amount of flour, resulted in a dough that rolled out well and evenly with no problems. The second rise didn't do much. It puffed up a bit, but nothing drastic. Baking took a little longer (about 5 mins longer) than the recipe indicated, and the final result was a cinnamon roll that was actually edible -- not sickeningly sweet like those awful things one finds in airports. Airy, cinnamon-y and appropriately sweet. One per sitting is enough, but finishing it doesn't make you have regrets (or a blood sugar attack).

I think there is a difference between active dry yeast and instant (or rapid rise) yeast. Instant is more concentrated so you need less.

Anyone who has baked before can see that this recipe needs tweaks to be successful. It turned out wonderfully with the changes I made: -boiled the potatoes over medium-high heat to evaporate as much water as possible -used two teaspoons of instant yeast-one has to assume that the two tablespoon thing was an error. Also, by using instant yeast, I was able to mix it into the flour directly and omit the 1/2 cup of water required for active dry yeast. I was able to use a lot less flour this way, although I still ended up with 21 small to medium-sized rolls. The dough took an hour to double in volume the first time even with the reduced amount of yeast. I would probably add more filling next time I make them, but they were great. Light, gooey, tender cinnamon rolls.

Rating: 3
These turned out well, but I had to finagle the recipe a little. Due to altitude, the water evaporated extremely quickly when boiling the potatoes. I added more, but perhaps a little too much. i ended up having to add about 3-4 more cups of flour than was called for, resulting in massive cinnamon rolls. I also used cream cheese icing rather than the glaze. I would add more cinnamon filling next time, but that's just my personal preference.

Rating: 4
These cinnamon rolls are really great. A lot of folks seem to have problems with the water:flour ratio. I think the key here is to boil the potatoes at medium heat (or higher). If the heat is ~ medium low, not enough water evaporates (and you have to add ~ 1+ cup of flour). A few modifications we've had success with: 1. initially mash the potatoes, then use a wand to puree the mixture 2. the rolls rise (a lot, like greg says). if you want giant rolls - e.g. as big as your spread hand - cut the dough to make 12. but keep in mind you could easily get 24 small ones.

This is a great idea, but a seriously flawed recipe. I bake a lot, and you can see just looking at the ingredients that the ratios are all wrong. And I saw all the previous reviews. So I cut back the water by almost half, but still had to add 2-3c (I quit measuring) more flour, rest the dough, and then rest/refrigerate the dough. So it made good cinnamon rolls, but nothing amazing. I ended up with 24 good sized rolls, used the amount of filling specified, and increased the icing some. Tasty, and I think I will make more rolls with a potato dough. Just not this one.

Rating: 3
I give this three forks because, despite tasting great, they were a pain to make. Like other reviews have said, the amount of flour to water is off. I had to add at least another cup before I could knead the dough. It did rise really well. Then rolling it out was another adventure. I add to add some flour then too. Finally I got it rolled up into a cylinder and cut into twelve HUGE rolls. As others have said, the filling did run out of the bottom a bit and burn/caramelize on the bottom of the rolls. I'll make it again, but with modifications.

Rating: 3
So, I read all of the reviews and thought I'd give it a try as written. It's a really wet day in Seattle, so I expected to need a little more flour, but this is crazy. There must be mistake in the formula, because this dough was so wet that it couldn't possibly work. I ended up adding about a cup more of flour and needed it with a dough hook for about 10 minutes at medium speed. It was still way too wet, but I thought I'd risk it. I used a lot of flour while patting/rolling it out, and it still was quite a mess to work with. I really should hav added more flour and gave it another rise, but I decided to go with it anyway. In the end, they taste great, but they didn't keeep much of a shape. I'll try it again and drain off a 1/2 cup of water from the spuds before mashing (I'll use that 1/2 cup to bloom the yeast).

SOOOOO GOOD. I make bread all the time and have a specific sweet roll recipe I use for cinnamon rolls, but I've always been on a hunt for a dough with this texture and now I've found it. Yes, the dough is really sticky but after reading other comments, I just used 1/4 cup of water instead of 1/2 cup and still added more flour, probably 1-1/2 to 2 cups more. You don't have to get your hands messy at all - just spread a good layer of flour on a board and with a rubber spatula scrape all the dough onto the flour and while you're kneading it (I toss it around lightly) just make sure there is always enough flour between your fingers and the sticky dough and you'll have a minimal amount of dough collecting on your fingers.

With the big storm on the east coast today, it was the perfect day to make cinnamon buns. These are AMAZING. Yes, the dough is 'sticky'. I found I needed to add a little less flour than others before me did because I kneaded the dough with the dough hook for a good long time and then let the dough rest for about 10 minutes. I was able to lightly flour the dough and get it into a bowl. It still was not the easiest dough to handle, but the buns are so light and tasty, it is worth the trouble. Perhaps the next time I will drain some of the potato water, but I realize it is the stickier dough that makes a lighter 'bread'. Also, I only had 1.5 packs of yeast on hand and the dough had no trouble doubling in volume....plus some!!!

Rating: 4
My family and I adored these! I had to add way more flour than it called for (by the 1/2 cup full), and still the dough was very soft. But with minimal handling, it worked fine. Some of the filling oozed out while baking, but it caramelized and made the rolls even more delicious. Since I added at least 1 1/2 cups more flour, it made about two dozen rolls. I'm looking forward to the batch in the freezer!

What an utter waste of time, energy, good ingredients (and love). I really would like to know how the other 4-fork-reviewers were able to handle this ... glob. If I hadn't read Munacils review while the potatoes boiled, I might have felt like an idiot. Munacil: I couldn' agree mor eon every single point. The amounts in this recipe are _way_ off. Even after adding almost 2 cup of bread flour to the original amount, the soggy mess was pretty much a bowl of gluey batter-style something, not even resembling dough. I ended up showing the mess on a sheet and baking a loafish cinnamon focaccia thingy. But I will never ever make this again. Instead I'd rather use ye olde Betty Crocker potato refrigerator dough for this... truly disappointing.

I am not going to rate this because everyone else raved, but have to say this was a disaster for me. I bake bread a few times a month and we have a cinnamon roll recipe I love. I was skeptical from the beginning, since most recipes I make are a 3-1 ratio flour to water, and this was more like 2-1. Two tsp. yeast is usually enough, two tablespoons? But the reviews were great, so I decided to try. I should have listened to my instincts. I had batter, not dough. Forget adding flour by tablespoons, I had to add by half-cups. And then I gave up and poured it into my bread machine which sort of stirred it around for a while, then of course with all that yeast when it rose it overflowed into the machine. I scraped it into my largest bowl, and it overflowed that too (into the oven). This is when the Flubber jokes started. Rolling it out? At least another cup of flour was absorbed just to keep it from sticking. By that time the proportions were way off, so I ended up with edible but not special rolls. I have no idea how anyone else made it work, but if I were to try it again, I'd reduce the liquid by a considerable amount.

These are fantastic!! I had a craving for tender, gooey in the middle cinnamon buns and these definetly fit the bill. My family devoured them. The only thing I could complain about was that the glaze was a little too sweet for my taste (although no one else thought so), the next time I make them I will try a cream cheese icing.

Just made these and they were great. A nice light texture compared to my typical more bready cinnamon roll. Next time I might add some grated apple with additional flour to the filling as this is a family favorite addition.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I made it exactly as listed, the only change was a technical one...cutting the rolls with a thread instead of a knife. I will be making these again and again. Still soft two days later, spread the extra buttery frosting to the edges of all rolls to keep moist. yummmmm...

These are the best cinnamon rolls. They were still moist one day later.I added raisins to the filling and will try nuts on the next batch. A real keeper!

You might have better luck with the filling if you first spread the butter out on the rolled dough first, and then sprinkle the sugar and cinnamon on top. It may stick better. Also, you may have too much butter versus sugar, and everything became runny.

I'd sure like to know what I did wrong because the bottom 1/3 of these turned into cinders and all of the cinammon filling ran out. Other than that, the top 2/3rds tasted great.
