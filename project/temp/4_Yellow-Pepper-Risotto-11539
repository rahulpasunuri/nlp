I was looking for ways to use up some bell peppers and tried this out. The only modification I did was eliminate the straining of the pepper part ...why? they were not even that juicy to have gotten much pulp out. I just chopped them up really well and i bet the flavor was no less.

I'd give this 3.5 forks if I could. I've learned how to improve this recipe and make it less work. You don't have to go to the work of roasting the bell peppers. Instead, cook them really well in the microwave; I used about 6 minutes. I did not strain them. I used red onion, and a lot of it like in a regular risotto, rather than shallots to give more flavor, and I added sliced button mushrooms to the onions and garlic. I was out of parmesan so used grated manchego instead, which was really delicious on top. This came out really well.

This was very good, though, as with all risottos, kinda labor intensive--also, it took much longer than the "20 minutes" the recipe indicates. I served it with lamb chops, but really, I think it would be much better with fish, like sole or trout.

Beautiful risotto! Also tried a variation omitting the zuchini, using red peppers insead of yellow, and substituting a cabernet for the white wine. It was less tangy and had a little more body, and also looked very pretty with a puree of yellow pepper as a garnish : )

Wow! One of the best risotto's I've ever had. Only changes I made were to omit the zucchini and substitute some sliced roasted yellow pepper instead. I also did not strain the puree. Absolutely delicious and beautiful color.

This is not our favorite risotto recipe, but it was quite tasty. Followed some previous advise and roasted the peppers. We did yellow peppers and the color and presentation of the dish is great. I think you need to be a bell pepper fan to really enjoy the overall taste.

Fantastic. This was the best risotto I ever made. I am planning on making it again next week.

Used red and yellow peppers, some pureed and some diced. Roasted them the night before. Omitted the zucchini. Added chicken from a purchased roasted chicken. Turned out to be flavorful, attractive, rich, and my guests loved it!

totally yummsky. I take my risotto very seriously and this was good stuff. Only pureed half the peppers and added the rest as diced. Also needed generous salting. Definitely worth it, wouldn't have guessed otherwise.

Wow. Great dish. The pureed peppers added an amazing and unusual flavor and texture. For a weeknight main course, we added two ounces of chopped pancetta, and sauteed them with the shallots and garlic. We also sauteed an additional quarter cup each of chopped bell pepper and zucchini before adding the rice. We didn't strain the yellow pepper puree, and we stirred in some chopped tomato right before serving.

Ehh...wish I could echo the raves for this dish, but I just can't. I love peppers and I love risotto, but ultimately, I think this recipe was far too labor intensive for the taste. To improve the basic flavor, I added some shrimp sauteed in butter and olive oil with lots of garlic and shallots. Poured the whole thing (including garlicy butter sauce) over the rice and it was better, but still nothing to write home about. still, don't let one off review disuade you - try it and decide for yourself.

Mmm...I made this with roasted yellow peppers and left out the zucchini. REALLY good, versatile risotto, my family loved it!

oh, yeah. This dish is sublime. My husband says to hook him up to this one like a pate goose. hummm... As far as the cooking time, it actually only takes 20 minutes to cook if you turn up the heat on the risotto pot. Time it and don't over cook.

I have been making this dish for several years. It is really yummy. The only thing is, do not add all you pepper puree in at once. Sometimes your peppers are large which makes more puree. You can always add more or save it for another use.

As per others, roasting the peppers was fabulous. Left out the zucchini as well and didn't miss it. Yum!

this risotto was really terrific. i used other members' suggestions and roasted my peppers [red and yellow] rather than boiling. several folks complained that this was too labor-intensive. i wondered what would happen if i cooked the arborio rice in four cups of broth uncovered without the constant stirring and adding broth bit by bit. guess what. it was truly fine [tho perhaps cheating] to do it this way. when i walked by my stove, i gave a stir, but i just dumped in the four cups of broth, left it simmering uncovered , and it was really easy. i added the diced peppers [didnt puree as others said dicing was just as good], wine and cheese towards the end when most of the broth was absorbed [i also omitted zuchinni as folks said that you couldn't taste them anyway]. very easy and everyone raved about it. this was another example of the epicurious community providing really fine suggestions. thank you, all.

Roasted the yellow bell peppers to bring out their sweetness. Added the juice from the peppers to the stock. Used a homemade chicken, turkey beef stock. Purchased a roasted chicken and shreaded it. Followed the recipe and the result was simply fabulous. So choice.

One of my absolute favorites, and I have found it gets simpler to make each time! I wouldn't call it an "everyday" dish because there is some labor involved, but it's certainly worthy of the effort three or four times a year. At our house, this is my "hello spring" dish that graces our Easter table. It's elegant enough for that type of event, but we also love it as a surprising change from regular barbeque fare. Often to cut prep time I will make the puree a day ahead, and occasionally the whole dish - it reheats beautifully, just have a little broth on hand in case it gets too dry. ENJOY!

Made this dish 10 years ago and re-found same recipe on epicurious. Loved it then and loved it now. Yes, it's a bit fussy (stirring, etc.), but with everything prepped beforehand, it's not that big a deal. Very taste - served with asparagus and roast lamb on Easter. Perfect. And simple.

I agree -- this was a lot of work! The presentation was very nice and colorful, and it was good. It was part of our Valentine's day dinner. My husband loved it. But I'm not sure I'd do it again due to the labor involved. I reserved some of the peppers (mix of red and yellow) for garnish. Happy Valentine's day anyway!

This was nice, but definitely not worth all of the labor. I was surprised by the strong "make it again" endoresements considering how much work it was. I would've probably liked it better if I'd followed the one reviewer's suggestion to not puree the peppers.

A wonderfully flavorful risotto! Try with 1/2 the amount of cheese for a lighter version.

Really wonderful risotto recipe! I did not put the zucchini in. Served it as a side dish instead (with garlic, chopped prosciutto and crushed red pepper). Like other reviewers, I also set aside a portion of the pepper and mixed it in during the last five minutes of cooking (along with the parsley and the parmesan). Definitely a keeper!!

We loved this! I pureed most of the peppers, but kept out about a 1/4 cup to stir in at the end. The zucchini gets overwhelmed by all the flavors, but it does add nice color and good nutrition to the dish. Will definitely make this again and again.

Easy and delicious. Don't puree the peppers; leave them diced for both taste and presentation. This risotto is satisfying and somewhat rich, but still works for an all-year round crowd pleaser. Serve with a side of meat in winter, or with a salad in summer.

This recipe is now a family heirloom since we first saw it in spring of 1995/6 I think. To the cook in Vancouver - its awesome with good lamb chops. The original issue had this with lamb chops rubbed with a bit of balsamic, black pepper and olive oil. Just kinda rubbed on and left for about an hour. Then broiled. Side was blanched scallions (the whole thinng without the green bits) and asparagus. perfect spring meal. Best I recall. My son is now expert at this he was about 15 when he started helping me stir it. Now he's the chef (soon to be 21) when it comes to this dish. WE also use the same technique but add other stuff instead of these veggies. Pureed pan roasted butternut squash and enoki mushrooms (mushrooms are not pureed). Great fall dish with grilled chicken.

This recipe was excellent! No need to puree the peppers. Any suggestions for a meat dish to serve it with?

Rating: 3
It turns out even better than I expected. My meat-lover husband complained about all the green stuff in it. But, when I tried to take away his plate and said you don't have to eat it if you don't like. He still grabed his plate tightly and insisted to finish the whole thing. So, I guess that tells somthing.

Tasty. Make sure that all of the people you will be serving like peppers, because the flavor is strong.

Rating: 4
So very tasty. I used 1 red, 1 yellow and 1 orange pepper. I diced them very very very finely so I didn't find pureeing necessary. I also sauteed 8oz of chopped shrimp (Argentinian Red) with a little olive oil and garlic and added it before the cheese. Yes, it's a bit of work, but outstanding!!!

Outstanding. One of the best risottos I have made. All my boyfriend could say was, "hmmmmmmmm," while he ate it. Don't overcook the zuchinni. Also, I used two yellow and one red pepper, to add more color. And don't totally puree the peppers, leave some whole pieces. You will love it!!!!!!

I have made many risottos. This one is very good. A few tips: if you can have someone help you cook, then do so side by side, with one making the risotto and the other preparing the add-ins. It will take a half an hour. Next time I do it, I will stir the risotto with one hand while preparing the rest of the meal. Preparing it in the order suggested wastes a lot of time. Also, I substituted the parmesan for some Pecorino Romano. I also added cubed chicken tenders. Drink with a good pinot noir. Also, not that any of you cheat, but next time I will buy some red roasted peppers in a jar and puree those. Overall, this was one of my favorite risottos ever. If you are serving 4-6 and this will be the main course, better double it. My wife and I and our 3 year old daughter finished this in one sitting (and no, we are not overeaters!). Make this one; you will be glad you did.

We really liked this but it took 40 minutes, not 20 to absorb 4 cups of stock. I don't like using chicken stock when I'm not eating chicken, I don't understand why so many recipes call for it. I used vegetable stock, skipped the zucchini (didn't see the purpose, there's no flavor to it, maybe included for texture?). I didn't see any reason to sieve the pepper puree and if you're only going to use 1 clove of garlic, why bother, I used 5. This was an interesting risotto, but the extra 20 minutes to cook it did throw off our other dishes.

I made this dish for my husband for Valetine's Day and used red peppers (instead of yellow). It was excellent. I cooked and pureed two of the peppers and the third one I cooked with the zuchini and put it all in at the end. My husband raved!! I will make it again but only for special occasions. It was pretty time consuming to do by myself. It would go a lot quicker with another set of hands, though. But definately worth it for those special meals.

Rating: 4
OUTSTANDING! Before I pured the peppers, I saved about 1/4 cup and added in at the end. It is not necessary to put peppers thru sieve. I added a good handful of parm cheese and then tasted and found that a full cup would probably be too overpowering. After I plated I added a little parm cheese with the parsley.

Incredible. Made a double batch for a dinner party of 6. Everyone raved about it and had second servings. Heated up leftovers the next night in the microwave and it was just as good. Will make a double batch again just for the family so we will have plenty of leftovers to enjoy. I did not change a thing other than to sub a mixture of red and yellow peppers for the yellow peppers and blended the peppers after softening. No sieving was required.

This is one of my favorites. It absolutely ROCKS. I sub in veg broth for the chicken broth, and it makes a great vegetarian entree. I also dice the zucchs pretty well and skip the sieve step. But 20 minutes? More like 40.

One of my family's favorite recipes... this is what I make for special occasions; however I always use red peppers for color.

This was delicious! I added a red pepper to the mix, and reserved about a third of the sauteed peppers to add with the zucchini at the very end. Although I did drain the pureed peppers, I ended up adding the liquid puree as the last liquid to the risotto, and then added all the pulp with the rest of the vegtables. It was beautiful and soo flavorful. Served it with steamed asparagus on the side and olive bread and got rave reviews. Will definitely make this again!

I have been trotting this one out to rave reviews ever since it first appeared. A couple of variations: You can use red peppers or a combination of red and yellow for vibrant results. Also, try reserving 1/2 the cooked peppers and adding them with the zucchini rather than pureeing them to add texture. Lastly, you can get by with way less than 1 cup Parmesan. But for something as rich as risotto, why bother?

This delicious dish is a real winner and drew raves from dinner guests. Beautiful presentation because of the yellow pepper color and green flecks from zucchini. However, it is very labor-intensive. From the chopping of the yellow peppers to ready-to-serve condition, I worked more than an hour. I will fix this again but I will plan to begin preparation much earlier than I did this time.

The recipe was great. I seeded the zucchini, and used fresh White pepper. See the second paragraph, first sentance. Your recipe needs a verb like cook or saute. Otherwise you are a great reference!
