I followed the recipe exactly but couldn't find good quality wild mushrooms, so used portabellas instead. The dish turned out to be unctuously delicious. I may have liked it even better when the leftovers were reheated. Next time I'll make in advance and reheat in the micro- plenty of other stuff to do last minute for Thanksgiving.

This rich side dish is a beautiful compliment to the Thanksgiving table. I make it exactly as per the recipe to rave reviews.

This has become a family favorite with our Christmas roast beef.

Really good, and I'm not normally a fan of mushrooms. I chopped the chestnuts a bit finer so that the crunchy texture would be more evenly distributed. The grey-brown color of this dish is not especially appealing so the addition of chopped chives is nice.

I made this a few years ago when I was given some chestnuts and didn't know what to do with them, plus being from the "mushroom captial" I always have mushrooms on hand. Now it's a family favorite and added to our Christmas dinner every year.I wouldn't change a thing.

Thanksgiving staple that has bled into Christmas staple. Regulars ask if this is going to be on the table.

While this was good, we didn't think it was excellent. It seemed to need another flavor, a little more spice perhaps? Or maybe it would be better served in small amounts as an accompaniment to meat. The chestnuts were a fun addition.

Excellent! We made this for a big Thanksgiving party, and it disappeared quickly. I had more than one person ask me for the recipe too!

Definitely should be served individually. Too many other side dishes would ruin its distinction. Absolutely special!

excellent and easy recipe. Was surprised by how much liquid was expressed during the cooking process-so add just what it calls for. But still tasted great. Husband added rosemary and tobasco sauce on day 2-really added a kick to it.

We loved this dish, but I made it for Thanksgiving and it didn't really go well with the traditional fare. I'll try it again with a more elegant dinner.

This is the first recipe I tried using chestnuts and now I'm hooked! I've never been able to find chestnuts in a jar here so I had to roast my own. Takes some time, but for this dish it's worth it. I think oyster mushrooms are the best to use in this one.

Yum Yum!! Everybody loved this dish! I used regular white buttons, dried & reconstituted shitakes, king oysters & crimini mushrooms. This is an easy make-ahead and heats up well and is easy to make. Serves great on top of mashed potatoes. Will definitely make again!!

I tried this then realized, although I like mushrooms, some would not. Was I surprised! It was the first thing gone on the Thanksgiving buffet! The jarred chestnuts were a bit mushy, but seasonally, you can find fresh-roasted and they have more texture.

Very good. I made this for Thanksgiving. I think that on a more casual day, I'd make it with plain ol' button mushrooms, but that could get boring. This was definately more festive. Also, as I'm not a fan of chestnuts, I'd skip them next time, but that's just me. Would make a great (but rich) pasta sauce, or similar.

Perfect pairing of flavors, it's a very opulent dish. The leftovers also make a wonderful base for mushroom soup.

Here are the substitutions I used to make this dish the cheap/quick/lazy way (and it still turned out to be amazingly delicious): dried thyme, dried pre-sliced mushrooms (mostly shiitakes) reconstituted with some hot water, 2 shallots + 1 big onion, no garlic, some random cooking wine from Chinatown that warned me to use it "for gourmet cooking only". Everyone loved it. LOOOOVED it.

Yowza! Yummy, yummy. Skipped the chestnuts since my husband wouldn't eat them. Made it in advance to the point of adding the cream, and stirred in the cream as I was reheating it. Easy and very rich.

I eliminated the Madeira and the recipe still came out great! I used about 1/3 of the butter and sauteed the shallots and garlic in a little olive oil, saving the butter for the mushrooms. Everything was so tasty and we're going to use the recipe on hamburgers, steaks, chicken, potatoes, couscous...

This dish is really great! I have made it the last two Thanksgivings and plan to do so again. It is easy and really good. Last year I made it for my in-laws who are very "gourmet," and got raves.

Did it for a big dinner party over roast beef and mashed potatoes. It was delicious. I made it a few times, and it is good even without chestnuts, and with portobello mashrooms. Madeira and thyme give this dish an outstanding taste.

I loved this recipe. Used it as a sauce over pasta. It was delish. Like one of the other reviewers, next time I will use portabello and button mushrooms.

This was without a doubt...delicious. Instead of jar chestnuts, we roasted & peeled fresh chestnuts. Also, due to time constraints, I prepared the recipe to the point of adding the cream and continued the recipe from that point on the day of dinner. The nutty flavor & additional texture from the chestnuts was well partnered with the the aroma of mushrooms, madeira & fresh thyme. This dish lost nothing from standing & being reheated over the next 2 days, so it really can be prepared a few days prior to, then finished the day of a big party. A definite keeper for busy people who love to cook & entertain!

This was a huge hit on Thanksgiving and tasted even richer the next day when the mushrooms really soaked in the madeira. It was a great combination with the Chestnut and Sausage Stuffing.

Delicious and easy. Couldn't find chestnuts so I used chopped hazelnuts instead (a nice Pacific Northwest addition anyway) and it was wonderful and quick to prepare. Even the person who is not a mushroom-lover liked this dish.

As I made this recipe, it filled the house with a wonderful arroma that made the whole meal even more wonderful. Not only was it easy to make, it was a crowning addition to a fabulous meal. Leftovers were GREAT the next day, so I may make it again ahead of time and serve it on top of fillet or prime rib. Would also be great over polenta or tofu.

I was a little disapointed with this recipe. I spent a great deal of time finding the best wild mushrooms, but they were overwhelmed by the Maderia and cream. If I make it again, I'll either cut back on both or use button mushrooms.

If you like Mushrooms this is the one for you, I added 2 handfuls of morels to the mix.......... Wow !

This is a great addition to the Thanksgiving table. Even tho the recipe says that you must make it right before serving, I made it much earlier in the day, and simply warmed it up, and it was great. I even served it the next day at a leftovers party, and it worked beautifully. Find as many wild mushrooms as you can, and the dish won't fail you.
