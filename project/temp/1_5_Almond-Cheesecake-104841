Also used 1 tablespoon of Almond extract. This cake is great with fruit. Crust is MUCH better with almond cookies and chopped, toasted almonds.

This cheesecake is OK. I made it for my father's birthday. He doesn't like sweets very much, but does like almonds so I thought it would be good. It was average and very plain. By no means a show stopper. It needs something to make it prettier. I did not use the low-fat cream cheese, not sure if that would have made a difference. Also - I added sugar and vanilla to the sour cream topping. It gave it a little more sweetness. The cake was very dense though and overpowered the sweet of the topping.

I should have listened the reviewer above me. The crust tasted like cardboard, with the exact same consistency. No crispiness whatsoever. I prefer crusts with butter in them that crisp when cooked. I could not taste any almond flavor in the cheesecake at all. Even topping the whole thing off with raspberries and blueberries could not save this cake. We ended up eating half and throwing the rest away.

I made this dessert for a dinner party and was disappointed. It was very bland. There was no almond or lemon flavor at all. If I were to make this again, I would use a teaspoon of almond extract and more grated lemon peel. The crust was nothing special, either.
