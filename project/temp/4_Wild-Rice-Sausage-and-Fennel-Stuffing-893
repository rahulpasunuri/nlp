Made this recipe for tonight's Thanksgiving dinner. It was a huge hit. I used sweet Turkey sausage. Also, as per another reviewer, I did add craisins. The flavor was great and it also added some color to the presentation. Looks a bit "beige" otherwise. Additionally, I chopped some flat parsley and added that as well. Nice color and flavor. FANTASTIC!

This is a great recipe! made it for friends who are gluten intolerant and it was a perfect accompaniment to Christmas eve dinner. It's also refreshingly easy to make compared to other stuffing recipes that call for much more chopping and more veggies.

This is AWESOME!!! Served it with Roast duck and Cranberry Sauce for Thanksgiving (what a great combo). I made a double recipe - which made a TON...not necessary, even for a big gathering. But everyone wanted some to take home, and we got to put some in the freezer. YUM! This is an entree in itself. Great cooked outside the bird, but would be wonderful inside as well. THANK YOU EPICURIOUS!!

Man, is this GOOD! Served with turkey for Thanksgiving Day family meal. Everyone, there were nine of us, really liked it.

I made this for Thanksgiving with the family because I can't eat wheat anymore and knew I couldn't eat the stuffing that would be there. It's so good I'm not sure I wouldn't have it for every Thanksgiving, even if I could eat wheat! I added a handful of dried cranberries towards the end of sauteeing the onions and fennel.

Great recipe! I took the idea from the other reviewers and threw in a handfull of dried cranberries and it was a GREAT suggestion to cut the savory taste a little. The fennel balanced well. I would highly recommend this and will make it again!

My first Turkey and it was awesome! Juicy and tasty. Not hard, either. --Cynthia www.HealthyKitchenware.com

This was our Thanksgiving favorite! Guests begged to take home the leftovers and/or called the following day for the recipe. -Cynthia www.HealthyKitchenware.com

Just made this and it's delicious! I used about half of the fennel and a brown/wild rice mix, but I definitely think it could have withstood all of the fennel.

Fantastic! We made it with a roast duck for Christmas dinner. A great combination of flavors and textures. I wouldn't do a thing to change it.

This is delicious as it is. However, I changed the recipe to include andouille and chorizo sausages.

I use 1/2 sweet sausage and 1/2 hot. I live in a really small town and when I first attempted to make this in 1995 fresh fennel was not available. I substituted leeks. It reappears on our Thanksgiving menu frequently.

This is a great recipe. I eliminated a lot of the fat by using chicken broth to saute everything and turkey sausage instead of pork. The excellent flavor was still there. This also freezes amazingly well.

This recipe is fantastic and SO easy. Just be sure to saute the fennel until it's tender. We served this on Thanksgiving and several people said that it was the best dish of the evening (and competition was fierce)!

If the fennel is properly sauteed until golden and tender, its flavor shouldn't be very strong. I believe every single person who had this (I served it as a side dish, not a stuffing) asked me for the recipe.

We liked this, but the fennel flavor was overpowering, even though I only used 2 fennel bulbs. Next time, I think I'll make it without any fresh fennel at all.

Super flavorful and everyone loved it. Made a batch for a dinner for 4 and thought I'd have leftovers. Yeah, right! I used spicy chicken italian sausage from Trader Joes, and it was wonderful. I added toasted pecans instead of walnuts and a handful of chopped dried cranberries. Also, to get the fennel to soften, I added a few tablespoons of water to the onion/fennel mixture after it had sauteed for a bit and covered it to let the steam soften the fennel. Served with pheasant (my friend bird hunts)and the brussels sprouts with shallots and mustard seeds from this site.

Great recipie, very easy to make, and made great leftovers. I used a mix of wild and brown rice. Worked great.

I have made this for Thanksgiving two years in a row and I am asked for recipe every year. It is even better the next day. I have also done it with spicy sausage for extra kick.

BIG HIT for thanksgiving! Everyone liked it - wish I had left in the walnuts! Next time I'll add parsley to break up the color.

Delicious, but we found it a little bland. We added sauteed mushrooms and parsley, and some dried cranberries. We thought it was a big improvement. Agree that fennel and sausage combo is a winner!

I made this to be served with deep fried turkey. Everyone at the dinner party asked for the recipe. The tastes of the Italian sausage and fennel were a wonderful enhancement to the wild rice. I added the toasted walnuts for the extra crunch. This recipe is definitely a "keeper".

After making this for two holiday dinners, I now know to bring copies of the recipe. It's a hit.

Excellent! Easy to prepare. The fennel added great flavor and was the perfect amount. I think it will make a great accompaniment to wild turkey which is what I intend to try next.

This was easy and delicious! We will have this again as a side dish soon. It seemed like a lot of fennel, but it cooks down nicely and is an excellent addition to the wild rice. I had to talk everyone into trying a new stuffing, but now they can't wait for me to make it again.

Yummy and Easy! What a wonderful complement to our turkey cooked on the barbeque. This may become our new traditional stuffing for Thanksgiving. One day later, everyone is already fighting for leftovers!!
