Absolutely brilliant! I followed the recipe exactly the first time and was amazed. Tonight I used leeks instead of red onions and added cubes of rutabaga along with the parsnips, since I was using up extra Xmas veggies, and it also turned out excellent. Rich and decadent...a definite keeper.

This is amazing made with one cup parsnips and one cup carrots. I have made it twice this way. My guests raved last night. It is not necessary to use flour and butter to thicken the sauce. After skimming the fat, I use my immersion blender to slightly puree the vegetables and the result is a beautifully thick and delicious sauce. I serve it over plain mashed potatoes. The dish is so rich not much more is needed. A really good zinfandel is essential for the best flavor.

Used spare ribs, because that's what I had. The meat was good, but the sauce had much less flavor than I expected - rather bland. Loved the mashed potatoes and parsnips.

Used beef spare ribs because that's what I had. The beef was good. However, I expected the sauce/gravy to have much more flavor than it did. It was rather bland. Loved the mashed potatoes and parsnips. Will make those again.

Really average short rib recipe.The flavors were nothing special and there are plenty of better ones on this site. I did however love the rosemary-infused mashed potatoes, which I shall do in the future with or without parsnips.

First signs of cooler weather and I get cravings for short ribs. This is an exceptional recipe. What works best for me at the end is to put the cooked ribs into a serving dish; then drain all the juices and vegetables through a sieve, so that the juices are separated from the vegetables; then put the juices into a separator so as to pour off the fat. Then, I recombine the juices with the vegetables in a medium saucepan, and reheat. I use a hand blender to pulverize the vegetables, which automatically thickens the sauce. Then I blend in the flour/butter mixture, and pour everything over the meat.

Wine-braised short ribs--really, what's not to love? I made this with zin, but it didn't seem that important in the end. Next time I'd just use any full- bodied red.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. I added carrots and mushrooms to the veggie mix. I also used a Shiraz instead of a zinfandel. Once I finished braising the ribs I removed them from the juices, then strained the juices from the veggies. Then I was able to properly skim all the fat that had accumulated in the gravy. Then I put the gravy back with the veg and thicken as per the recipe. I served the ribs with the mashed as suggested but eliminated the parsnips. Delish.

I know it is so annoying when people review how they totally changed the recipe so it's almost a totally different dish. In this case: Guilty. But I had to share b/c I felt it demonstrated how versatile this recipe is. I used lamb shoulder chops instead. I know, totally different dish. And I used Petit Syrah instead. But everything else - the timing, the proportions were the same and it was amazing. And I would say pretty easy.

I cooked the shortribs for 3 hours, as other reviewers had suggested, and they were falling off the bone and quite delicious. Even though I botched the gravy and we ate them without, they were still juicy and good. Served with spinach and horseradish mashed potatoes.

Served it last night, and it was a hit. I cooked the ribs closer to 4 hours, and I also added sliced mushrooms to the vegetables.

Fantastic. This is the second recipe for short ribs that I tried and it was superior to the first. It was simple. I prepared it the day before so I could chill the liquid and skim the fat, which really made it light and tasty. The next day I reheated the liquid and followed the thickening directions. Yummy. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I took the advise of others and used a dry rub (my own blend) on the meat and let it sit for a day. Also, browed the meat before adding in the liquid. I served this + potatoes in a pasta bowl with grilled asparagus on the side. Everyone loved it! Next time I'll use Syrah rather than Zin (I'm not a big Zin fan). I also added a Gremolata from Bon Appetit Oct 2007 - - adds a special umph to the presentation. Very good over all.

Made the recipe as is and it came out perfect. The flavors are VERY rich, but delicious! The short ribs were so tender and the meat was fantastic. The only change I would've made to this meal would have been to add a green vegetable, maybe brussel sprouts? The plate was very brown. Used a nice bottle of Zin. Also, I would maybe omit the parsnips from the mashed next time. But all in all, a keeper!

This was fantastic! I will definitely make this again. Wish I had taken a picture, because it was perfection. This entire dinner was like comfort food to the Nth degree. The beef was fall-off-the-bone tender. The parsnips were a nice touch, too.

Really delicious. Followed the recipe as written, the flavors were really wonderful, and the house smelled amazing while these cooked.

This was delicious! Didn't have any rosemary at the store, so used thyme ~ still wonderful. Much easier than many other short rib recipes and as good! Might try again with a drier wine...

This is a great basic recipe for short ribs - served it over garlic mashed potatoes with green beens. This amount would just serve 6 so if you have any meat lovers I would increase the amount. Also, the ribs need to cook for 3.5 hours.

This was wonderful. Totally worth the effort. Definitely make sure you make it with well marbled short ribs. Used a $5 bottle of zin from the market and it turned out fine. Honestly, cannot say enough about how well it turned out.

Rating: 4
Beautifully rich sauce with intense flavor and depth. I used shallots in lieu of red onions and turnips instead of parsnips. I debated on the quality of Zin to use...just couldn't justify using a really good bottle so used a South African which was just fine. Got to drink my high-end Zin with dinner ; ) My only complaint was the amount of fat on short ribs and in sauce. This is a cholesterol bomb, but worth it on occasion. Salad tomorrow!

I really wished that I didnt basically waste these ribs on this recipe. It wasnt bad but it wasnt as great as everyone else said. The flavors were good but I would def make this with as a roast and not with the ribs.

Rating: 4
This was really great with a couple of tweaks. I kicked it up by first marinating the ribs in a dry rub of Essence of Emeril (recipe easily found on the Net) for 24 hours. I used a late harvest Zinfandel for a sweeter finish, added 1/3 cup of dried cranberries, then in the last half hour added 8 oz. of crimini mushrooms, halved. I think I would use more rosemary next time or dried rosemary since the flavor got cooked out in the braising.

Very good recipe - easy to make considering the number of servings. Didn't make the mash potatoes - regular mashed taste great with the recipe. Like many others, I added carrots to the short ribs as well.

My husband, who never, never talks about food ever, has not stopped talking about these ribs. They were so good. The only thing I changed was I added half carrots and half parsnips to the ribs.

Really nice. I left out the parnsips and used a Shiraz. Wonderful sweetness in the red onions. Great sauce.

I loved this recipe. I added baby cattots to the pot while it baked in the oven and it was really good. I also did it with regular beef ribs, less expensive than short ribs and it was great. I did regular mashed potaotoes. I think this is better than trying to compete with the meat. There was plenty of flavour from the gravy on the potatoes. I used more rosemary than the recipe called for.

Rating: 4
OMG! Soooo Good. You need 2 ribs/pp, the veggies should be strained out from the liquid before making the gravy. Make the ribs the day before and remove the THICK layer of fat off the top before finishing. By all means, use the parsnips and do make the potato mash. This is a sure thing recipe to impress friends.

Rating: 1
Not sure what went wrong, but this was dry (I even added more wine), and I don't know what they're talking about regarding "a gravy." That would only be if you pureed the final roasted vegetables in the pot. I couldn't even bring myself to eat the leftovers. Disappointing all around. Not how I think of shortribs at all.

Rating: 4
This was yummy! Thanks to the other comments, I made this a day ahead and let the ribs and the sauce cool over night. Very easy to pick the fat off the top of both the next day. The sauce was exceptional...I think the parsnips made a big difference. Didn't make the mashed potatoes as someone brought a potato casserole that went fine with it.

Rating: 4
This was outstanding! The only thing I did differently was I didn't brown the short ribs in all butter - I used about 2/3 olive oil & 1/3 butter. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I highly HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!

Rating: 3
This was good, not outstanding. For all the effort and expense, including almost $30 worth of short ribs, I guess I was expecting it to blow me away. My gravy didn't thicken up as much as I wanted, so I added a little cornstarch. I did like the blend of rosemary and parsnip with the meat (and will be sprinkling rosemary on my roast parsnips from now on), but I think I'll keep looking for that ultimate short ribs recipe.

I made this with 30 pds of ribs for Christmas Eve dinner. I have made it four or five times before. This is an excellent recipe! My entire family LOVED it!

Rating: 3
Had very high hopes for this dish based on previous reviews. Nice, but not stellar. I'd make it again but omit the parsnips in the braise since they absorbed much of the wine and kept the alcohol taste, they're not needed in my opinion and I LOVE parsnips. Also would decrease the wine to 3 cups and boost up the broth

I've made this dish twice now for dinner parties and guests rave every time ("best short ribs I've ever had" etc). The parsnip really adds a nice counterpoint in the sauce, although I don't love it as much in the mashed potatoes and just prefer the potatoes without them. The meat falls off the bone tender, and is so rich and delicious, even better the next day. Later that night, I shredded some of the meat into grilled tortillas for decadent short rib tacos served with creme fraishe. Nothing short of amazing.

Awesome. Mouthwatering, tender meat that falls off the bone. No need to set the table with a knife! An easy recipe and a big hit for crowds. Use your "dutch oven" or heavy bottomed stove to oven cookware.

Good but not great short ribs recipe.

Rating: 4
YUM! This was so good. I have to admit, I usually use a slow cooker for short ribs, but this made the meat really tender - put it in there for 2 hr 45 min. I halved the recipe and got rid of the fat by using a fat separator (i separated the solids first). I've done the whole thing with putting it in the fridge for a day and just taking the hard fat off but sometimes i can't wait that long! the fat separator works well. I added some sherry vinegar at the end. I liked the gravy. Definitely make the mash - I added extra milk and rosemary - it goes really well with the meat and gravy.

Rating: 3
Very good recipe, extremely tasty. I tweaked it a little - cooked it in a crock pot vs. oven for 10 hours, meat was unbelievably tender & marinated. I also added some shallots and used less wine. I agree with the cook that said it could use a little more depth past the wine - next time I may cut it with red wine vinegar as well. Regardless, excellent tasting, easy to make.

Rating: 4
This is a delicious and easy recipe. The first time I made it my family devoured it and I made sure to make more ribs this time around. As to the butter issue in the mash, I think it's a misprint. Both the rib and the mash recipes start with three T. butter, divided. I would just use the 6 T in the mash. A real keeper.

This is a great dish! I didnt change a thing to the ingredient list other than to cut the recipe in half because there were only two of us. I started it the day before and refrigerated it over night, then finished cooking it the next day. I skimmed off the congealed fat before putting it back in the oven. Others are right in that it did take longer to cook than suggested. I dont use parsnips much so wasnt sure, but the flavor they added to both the short ribs and the mash was perfect. I will cook the potato and parsnip separately next time...better to control even consistancy.

Rating: 4
I didn't make the mash, but the ribs and parsnips were delicious. I used short ribs that were cut crossways through the bone into 1" - 1 1/2" strips and then cut the meat/rib chunks into stew meat-size pieces, which reduces the cooking time by a half-hour or more, depending on how tender you want the meat.

Rating: 4
This is absolutely delicious. Picked up the beef ribs from my butcher, not cheep for a humble piece of meat, but the ribs were big and meaty. This is a definite keeper in my books, and I to think the parsnips are essential in the braise and in the mashed potatoes.

Rating: 3
This is 3.5 stars for me... I recommend cooking this at least the night before you want to serve this... it's essential for the flavors to mature properly. I also agree the parsnip is a must have for the ribs and the mash. They provide some excellent nuance to the dish. I recommend removing as much fat as possible to maximize the flavors -- easier to do after it's been in the fridge overnight.

Rating: 4
Outstanding and easy to make. Forget the Parsnp mash potatoes, regular mash was better. For the ribs I added 3 Tbs of Tomato paste with the wine which added great flavor and thickened the broth. Less parsnip did not hurt it either. Regular onions are fine too. Made it a few times, each to great reviews, and no leftover.

I made this last night and it was quite good. However, as my husband and I were the only ones home, I halved it. I had 4 good sized ribs and a fifth smallish one. It barely fed my husband. I had just the smallish one. You'd need a lot more than 8 to feed 6-8 people.

i modified this recipe for a crockpot. i reduced the amount of wine and broth the recipe called for. it worked out just fine. delicious meal but i found the downside to be the overpowering aromas from the cooking process. i think it is wise to air out the place during/after cooking this.

My first time to use parsnips or short ribs. I followed the directions. I not only can't wait to serve them again, but I've vowed to try new ingredients regularly. This is a great recipe and meat becomes very tender.

These were excellent, I would, however, suggest baking about 1 - 2 hours longer in the oven. I also served with fresh sauteed spinach, was an excellent accompaniment.

Remarkably good. Unlike some of the previous reviewers, I think the parsnips are essential in the braise AND the mashed potatoes. They add depth to the somewhat generic red wine gravy. One of the best preparations for short ribs I've ever tried.

Very yummy, the Rosemary - Parsnip Mashed Potato recipe was a bit odd as it said 3 tbsp butter and then another six tbsp of butter at the end, however the recipe only mentioned adding the butter to the milk. I love butter so I added the first three tbsp to the milk and mashed in the other 6 tbsp before adding the milk which made them extra great. Does anyone, especially Bon Appetit, have another suggestion.

This was outstanding. My husband couldn't stop raving about the ribs. Would leave the parsnips out of the mashed potatoes though in the future. Will definitely make again.

I am not a big consumer of short ribs because of the price. I remembered when humble cuts came with a humble price. These were better than the ones ordered at a restaurant.

The short ribs themselves, bone-in of course, were out of this world. So amazingly tender and flavorful. However, I felt the sauce/gravy was just so-so. It was very rich, in a one dimensional way. I can't decide if I want to try again and tweak the recipe (perhaps add acidity to cut it, like sherry vinegar) or to try an entirely different sauce recipe.

As another reviewer noted, I also used the boneless ribs from Costco and they worked very well. I would recommend making this a day (or two) ahead of time and re-heating when you want to serve. I did this, and stopped the process just before preparing the gravy (i.e. when the ribs were cooked after 2.5 hours, I cooled and then chilled everything per the recipe. HOWEVER, I did not start the gravy prep (addition of flour/butter and thickening). If you refrigerate at this point, the fat will separate and congeal on top, making removal of the fat really easy. Then, I proceeded to heat and thicken the gravy and add the ribs to heat through on the day of.

Made for company twice in one week, replacing the rosemary in the potatoes with thyme for one meal. Also, used boneless short-ribs from Costco, which were cheaper than the bone-in my butcher had...Regarding the earlier comment on parsnips, I would think that they could be omitted from the mash if folks didn't care for them, but the flavor is essential to distinguish the sauce from a generic "beef-in-wine" braise - it adds a nice little bite that wouldn't be there otherwise. Plus, once the sauce is complete, they're almost totally broken down and probably not identifiable by any picky eaters at the table. Just my $0.02 on the matter...

Delicious and very, very easy. My family said it was the best short ribs I'd ever made. I was concerned that the flavor would be too "winey" given that you use a whole bottle of zinfandel, but it was not. We're not big parsnip fans, so I left those out. Meat was like buttah. Will definitely make again. Does NOT serve 8...barely serves 6, especially if one of those is a ravenous 14-year-old boy! Served with goat cheese mashed potatoes instead of those included with recipe. YUMMY!
