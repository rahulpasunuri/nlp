Ehh. Not very interesting. Needs something for texture and taste interest. My wife suggests walnuts and/or blue cheese--would probably be good.

I mixed the vinagrette with another recipe and thus added 2 tab. red wine, 2 tab. orange juice, 1 teas. salt, 1 teas. sugar and 2 oranges peeled, cut up in segments.
