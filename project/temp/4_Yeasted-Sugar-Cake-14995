This is a wonderful not-too-sweet cake, that I enjoy serving as a weeknight dessert.

This is a fabulous recipe. I've been making it for years. Yes - pour it into the pan. Also, I use Demerara or some other course sugar for a really pretty finish and an interesting texture.

I am just eating a big wedge of this with a cup of tea. I ground some cardamom and added it to the sugar topping. Not too sweet, yeasty, and rich- tasting. Yum! Back for another piece...

I loved the yeasty flavor of this cake. It reminded me of the Sara Lee butter struesal coffee cake. My husband did not like it on its own, but enjoyed it with the carmelized apples I had made to go with it. My six-year-old didn't really touch it. I went with the suggestion of just dumping the dough into the pan, and it worked just fine. Next time I might try to swirl cinnamon and sugar into it and top it with struesel.

Ok, so this isn't exactly a cake in the traditional sense. And I agree with the cook from Eugene... I think just dumping it into the pan is the way to go. The dough is too soft to really shape in to a disk on the counter. That being said, it's a great dessert and strangely addictive. The sugar crust is wonderful and goes excellently with summer and winter fruit - or just plain. My boyfriend loved it becuase it's not too sweet and has a great yeasty flavor. Since moving to Chile, Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone has been my faithful cooking companion and has always had great ideas for using the great produce that grows here. This recipe just reaffirms my faith in this book.

I made this exactly as written (using a lemon zest and vanilla variation), and we loved it just with fresh backberries on the side. It would be perfect for a brunch I think--just sweet enough but not really sweet. The only change I'd make is I saw now reason (only trouble!) in shaping it on the countertop before putting it in the pan. Next time I'll just dump it right in. I also used a little less butter and sugar on the top. My little ones didn't think it reall counted as "cake" but my husband gobbled it up. No way we're going to get 12 servings out of it.

Pretty easy recipe, definitely not a sweet cake, but very yummy with thawed frozen berries and whipped cream. I love the sugary buttery crust.

I made this for the first time today and thought it was a terrific cake. Easy to make, with very simple ingredients. It could easily be dressed up to make a terrific coffee cake. I served mine with a simple blueberry sauce, but even plain it's great.

Folks, this is a bread. It is very good bread. But it is not a cake. Sure, have it with compote and so forth. It is too soft to toast.
