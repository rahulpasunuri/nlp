a good potato salad can be oh sooooooo good! this non-creamy variation is such a wonderful change from the traditional variety! i made a huge batch (just doubled the recipe) for a family picnic, and not a scrap was left. kids loved it, my great aunts and uncles loved it. the combo of slight tang from the vinegar, pep from the tabasco, and sweetness of the bacon was a perfect mix on a warm, sunny day. the only change i'll make in the future is a drastic reduction in the olive oil. it left a pretty deep greasy pool in the serving dish. half the amount should be plenty.

I'm the previous reviewer who found it too bland and too much dressing. With these changes, I found it to be excellent: increase vinegar to 4T, using half white wine vinegar and half red wine vinegar, increase mustard by 1/2T, decrease oil by 3T. (I think you could even decrease by 3.5 or 4T, in fact.) Increase greens by about 2-3 cups. Cook the potatoes in one batch, just adding the yams after the russets have cooked for about a minute, then toss them with the 2T dressing. Then immediately toss them with the greens, bacon, and rest of the dressing while still very hot. This will cause the greens to wilt gently.

The best potato salad I've ever made. I took the suggestion of some other reviewers and added yellow, orange and red sweet peppers. I sauteed them with shallots in the bacon grease before adding them to the salad and it was delicious. I also roasted the potatoes and used arugula instead of mustard greens. It was a total hit. I will never again return to the world of mayonnaise-based potato salads!

I am really into the idea of this recipe, but it needs more flavor. I even measured the ingredients, which I normally do not do for dressing, and it was bland--needs more acid. I used a mix of spinach and arugula, which I realize is not as flavorful as mustard greens, and I did use half the bacon, but arugula does have a pepperiness, and importantly, the potatoes themselves tasted bland, even in the bites that had a nice chunk of bacon in them, so even if the greens were more flavorful, the starchy part would still need more. There was also way more dressing than needed, so I felt like I had wasted a lot of olive oil. (Fortunately I think the excess dressing will keep, and I plan on doctoring it up for use in other salads.) I do love this type of salad, with gently wilted greens, so next time I'll try this with a more flavorful and acidic dressing. Some lime juice maybe?

Delicious! I bet parboiled and roasted would be awesome too. I added shallots in the vinaigrette, red pepper, and jalepeno -- yum!

I made this again this weekend and believe that I have improved upon the final result. I par-boiled both the yams and russet potatoes then tossed with olive oil, pepper and salt then roasted them in the oven at 375 till golden brown. Let cool completely then toss with the greens and dressing.

I bet you I haven't made this in 12 years, yet I still remember it and look forward to making it again. Bold, assertive, and loaded with nutrition, you gotta try it.

Absolutely lovely! My only change was I used arugula. Will be repeating through out the summer.

This is my favorite potato salad so far.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. The mustard greens and bacon are key. One thing I can see being an issue is if you don't cook the two types of potato to the same tenderness. I've made this recipe twice, the first time I realized I didn't have honey, I used brown sugar (about 3/4 cup) and it tasted great. But with the honey, it really pulls all of the flavors together well. Also, because it's not mayo-based, easier for a picnic.

Lovely.....especially with the mustard greens. They give it a needed peppery bite

I doubled the recipe except for the oil, that sounded like a little too much. Had family over for dinner and served with bbq baby backs. Everyone loved it, no left overs. Will make again.

After a quick trip to the farmers market this morning I made this with roasted new red potatoes and arugula. Added some kosher salt, fresh ground pepper, and crumbled gorgonzola. It was a hit. The flavors are fabulous!

I like this rendition of potato salad. I've made this quite a few times and it's always tasty. Having it with baked ham and black-eyed pea salad for New years day buffet.....

This is a great dish to accompany a deep-fried turkey. In Wisconsin we are hardy (and hearty) souls so we did a deep-fried turkey yesterday to combat cabin fever. The two potatoes in this dish take care of the traditional side dishes served with turkey so it seemed like a good choice to bring to the party. And it was a hit with everyone there. I used baby spinach instead of the mustard greens. I will definitely make it again.

This was a refreshing alternative to the traditional mayo-based(yuck) potato salad. I, too, substituted the mustard greens with baby spinach leaves. I made this salad for a birthday party and everyone loved it. It has a lovely taste and is colorful. I highly recommend it! Definately a keeper!

This salad is very delicious, although knowing the taste of raw mustard greens, one must surely wilt them first in a little bit of the bacon fat with some of the dressing and chopped red onion. Steaming the potatoes instead of boiling is so easy and they hold their shape very well without getting mushy & crumbly. It's a keeper in my book!

I loved this salad. We served it with grilled turkey and the flavors blended well. I am going to make it for a party next weekend.

I made this dish on Saturday for a small dinner party with broiled salmon steaks. I substitued lightly steamed baby spinach for the mustard greens, because the grocery store didn't have mustard greens at the time. It's a tasty and colorful alternative to regular potato salad. I think I won't use as much dijon mustard next time, the flavor was a little stronger than I personally prefer.
