Served as a second course with Sun Dried Tomato Cornbread this Thanksgiving to fantastic reviews. The Vinaigrette was so fresh, a wonderful way to add cranberries to a holiday meal in a new and different way. I would use a sweeter blue cheese than Stilton next time for a slightly softer flavor. The raspberry vinegar is a must for me, the hint of raspberry really set off the whole salad. A new favorite in my house.

If I could give the dressing a broken fork rating, I would. I attempted it twice and twice, it separated just as I removed it from the heat.

My dinner guests couldn't stop raving about this.Be sure you don't taste the dressing by itself, as it will seem sour. It all comes together in the salad.

This is a delightful combination and very easy to make.

Based on all the positive reviews about this salad, as well as the fact that I love all the ingredients, I just knew this was going to be out of the park. Sad to say, the end result was less than satisfying. I've never given a recipe on this site an average or lower rating before (and have often been amazed and skeptical about others who've down-rated recipes), but this one just didn't satisfy. Glad so many others love it.

This is one of the best salads I have ever had. I couldn't find fresh OR frozen cranberries so I used 1/2 Craisins (dried sweetened cranberries and 1/2 fresh raspberries. Guests raved about it. Then we drank the rest of the Port for dessert! Will make it again for sure.

Absolutely one of the best salads I've ever made. Made it for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Used butter and leaf lettuce, and it held up just fine. Definitely worth doing again!!

A wonderful salad. I used a good quality blue cheese in place of the Stilton and the results were still very good. Loved by all in attendance. Will definately make again.

I made this for my daughter's college graduation party and substituted frozen raspberries for the cranberries. After letting the vinaigrette mixture cool, I strained it on to the salad, so that the seeds from the raspberries would not conflict with the pistachios. It was delicious and well-loved by my guests.

I made this salad for friends recently, and I knew it was a hit when my 18 year-old asked if my friends could come for dinner again...he wanted more of the salad! Now that I have found shelled pistachios, its a breeze to make.

I just spent 45 minutes trying to find this recipe again. I made it years ago at Christmas and it was a huge success. I plan to make it again this year!

I served the salad to a group of friends and it received rave reviews. When I was making the dressing I was worried that it wouldn't be sweet enough since there is no sugar added to sweeten the cranberries, but it turned out absolutely delicious and very unique. I really recommend it and will definitely make it again!
