i'm delighted to have come across this recipe and will probably be making it a couple mornings a week... i replaced the butter with bacon fat and in re-oiling the pan, used lots more than was called for. besides that followed the recipe. used stone-ground white cornmeal.

use 1/2 corn meal,& 1/2 flour. cut salt in 1/2. roast the corn. add minsed scallion, & jalapeno. so basically this recipe sucked.

Very bland. Not worth the effort.

Very good with honey butter or just honey

These cakes were a bit bland. If I did make them again, I would serve them with honey butter OR spice them up with some jalepenos and cheese.
