I agree that this should be deleted from the site - I'm looking for a good coffee ice cream recipe and get... this! I also agree with "Realityville" that there are plenty of great ice creams at the grocery store. I just won't be searching recipes for them if that's what I want.

This is a no-brainer recipe (and very tasty, I might add :)) but sometimes it is just what the doctor called for- especially after a long day of "taking care of business". A person could make a million modifications and variations on this recipe and have it be successful. Thanks for posting the "Why didn't I think of that?"s as well as the gourmet!

Unbelievable. Shame on all three of you! I guess you're lucky(?) enough to have plenty of time on your hands that you can spend baking and making ice cream from scratch all the time. Some of us live in the real world and don't have the time or sometimes just the energy to do that -- that's the time when recipes like this come in handy. My kids love stuff like this, and it's so easy that I or they could put it together in a snap. It might not be "fancy fare", but who wants fancy schmancy every day? Besides, not everyone is as "worldly" or "gourmet" as you three believe yourselves to be. Oh, BTW, there are so many quality ice creams around, it's not necessary to make it from scratch all the time. In fact, there are lots of higher-end edibles around now so it's not necessary to make EVERYTHING from scratch. Sheesh, grow up!

I typed in "Ice Cream" into the search engine. I just bought a suped up Ice Cream Machine and I was dying to try it out. I was appalled that this was even included. "Hey, I know... let's dip a chocolate bar into a jar of peanut butter! That sounds so epicurian!" I concur with the previous poster... delete this monstrocity.

How convenient..you can go to Wendy's and call it out. Ditch this from the site.

um...should epicuious even bother investing space for recipes fom "too busy to bake"? what in the world. this is embarassing. this is not a recipe, its a list of random things that go good together. like: graham crackers, peanut butter, and m&m's...
