I believe Mr. Grimes was playing a sick joke on the Gourmet readership. The description fails to mention the hours he spent laughing at the thought of earnest people trying to make this labor-intensive jello food. If you want a kitschy 60s era meal and you have a whole afternoon to waste in the kitchen, then by all means knock yourself out with this farce of a recipe.

Tasted great; didn't jell as I would have liked. Was the gelatin I was using too old? Was the fridge too warm?
