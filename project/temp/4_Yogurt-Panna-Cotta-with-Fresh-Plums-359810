This is a wonderfully light, summery dessert and it's very easy. I don't make it in a cake pan because I love serving it in my crystal dessert goblets and I think it's easier that way. The plums add a nice tartness to the creamy panna cotta. I've also crumbled ameretti cookies over the top. It takes me 30 minutes, but should chill at least 4 hours - I know, they say 8 but . . . .

This dessert was a hit. To make it easier to serve, I made this in a spring form cake pan and it worked wonderfully. The real winner was the plum sauce. I've been asked to make just the sauce again, to pour over yogurt or ice cream.

This is so versatile. It works very well with low fat yogurt. I've added vanilla or coffee essence when I don't want to bother with the compote (plums, cherries strawberries any fruit works well with this). Plus it's so easy.

Good recipe. My guests liked it as Easter dessert served with fresh berries.

I love Panna Cotta but had never made it before. It was superb! I thought I could improve on this recipe by using one of Thomas Kellers Panna Cotta recipes. By far this one is the best I have ever tasted. Perfect when you want something with the sense of being rich but is actually very light.

Panna cotta has been a favorite dessert choice when eating at good restaurants but I had always been reluctant to try to make it myself. After making this recipe, it's going to become one of my staples because it is easy, takes little time (actually making it vs. letting it set up) and it's incredible! I made the panna cotta using full-fat Greek yogurt and it was perfect -- creamy and just as good on the 5th night as it was the first. I let it set up for 8 hrs. and the only thing I did wrong was try to unmold it by putting the bottom of the cake pan in hot water for only 15 seconds or so and it wouldn't fall out of the pan, so I did it again for one minute and it unmolded easily but the edges had started to "melt" a little bit. Next time I'll try 30 seconds. After sitting the 8 hours everything was fine. Since I didn't have the plums I used strawberries (ones I had frozen from the garden) and used the rest of the ingredients from the recipe. Fabulous compote. There is nothing better than panna cotta!! This recipe can be the base for countless panna cotta dishes. Highly recommended.

I made this with Splenda sugar substitute because we are on a low-carb diet, and I used fresh blueberries I made into a compote for the topping because plums were not available. The panna cotta was fabulous, and my husband had 3 portions of it. It was creamy and light, and did not have the sourness that I usually associate with yogurt. It would be great with any kind of fruit compote, and I will definitely make it again!
