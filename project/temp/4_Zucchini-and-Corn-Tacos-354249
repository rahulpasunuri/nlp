Really like the flavors all mixed together. Didn't have the corn tortillas, used pita bread instead.

This recipe was fine if you want to use up extra zucchini, but as far as making it for pleasure eating, I'd say stay away. It was bland, nearly flavorless, and it took way to long to cook for the results it yielded. If you want an excellent veggie taco, try this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Mushroom-Rajas-and-Corn-Taco-with-Queso-Fresco-358750

I made this just as recipe recommended and family loved it. We topped it off with a tomatillo salsa also found on this webite. I know that the combination is a keeper.

This was a really great vegetarian taco recipe and a good way to use up abundant zucchini. I made mostly per recipe and resisted tweaking, although my final ratios of ingredients was likely off (lots of zucchini at this time of the year!, used corn from only one cob and added some extra black beans to compensate - but this seems to be a forgiving recipe). I used fresh sweet corn and toasted per recipe - this really brought out the sweetness of the corn. The corn stuck like crazy to the pan but the bits all came off when I added fresh chopped tomatoes. Used homemade black beans (unseasoned) and fresh oregano (not epazote). My black beans were not quite done so I ended up adding a bit of the bean cooking liquid to the zucchini mix with the beans  this made the taco filling more saucy and cooked for longer than I would have preferred (to finish the bean cooking), but the extra cooking time made the recipe turn out much better. My final taco filling was fairly saucy and the zucchini quite tender. The reviewer who found it dry may want to add a little water or more tomatoes to moisten (probably depends on water content/size of the zucchini and tomatoes). Be sure to add the toasted corn at the end to add a bit of sweet crunch. I was worried about lack of flavor in the final mix (seemed bland and needing spice), but it was great in the final taco assembly. I made fresh corn tortillas (really easy  Manseca masa bag recipe, use parchment when pressing or rolling to avoid sticking and "dry" the parchment in the pan every couple of tortillas). Tacos were very delicious topped with a grated sharp flavorful cheddar, guacamole, a bit of sour cream and fresh diced tomatoes (I did not even use salsa and still was great).

for someone new to cooking anything mexican this was easy and delicious!!! I used dried Oregano with good results; 1 tsp. Also toasted the fresh corn which gave it good rounded flavours. Would try a tastier cheese than Monterey Jack to give it a bit more of a cheesy kick! Would highly recommend - was enjoyed by all.

this recipe is so delicious, I've made it a bunch of times already! I skipped toasting the corn, since I like it a little crunchy and didn't want it as cooked. I added a little chicken stock when I threw in the zucchini, and skipped the oregano and the cheese. It didn't need it, it was grrreat!

This recipe is really delicious. I expected a nice basic vegetable dish, but with the toasted fresh corn, caramelized onions and fresh oregano, the flavors are exceptional. I cooked black beans as I prefer the texture to canned, used queso fresco, and a box of chopped Italian tomatoes rather than fresh. It was really perfect. The filling is good on its own but is super with the warmed corn tortillas. Will add to my list of favorites to make again.

This was a good weeknight meal. Nothing fabulous but I will surely make it again.

I didn't follow the recipe to the tee - did a kind of lazy version, without all the ingredients, canned corn instead of fresh, and red kidney beans instead of black beans, and added caramelised onion, and it was still delicious. Fresh and light and tasty... It must be amazing if you do it properly!

Very healthy and tasty tacos. We added a jalapeno, and served them with cilantro and lime. It was very good - will make again.

This couldn't possibly serve four. I halved the recipe for myself, figuring I would have some leftovers, and ended up eating the whole thing. It was THAT delicious. I ditched the epazote/oregano idea, and didn't bother with the cheese either. It was simply perfection.

This was freaking delicious. I didn't bother with the epazote/oregano or the cheese. Like I suspected, this dish needed neither. I added a sprinkle of cayenne when I was sauteing the zucchini, and a splash of chicken stock to help the zucchini cook faster/simmer everything together. Man oh man, this came out incredible. I added some shredded romaine, and heated the tortillas up in a skillet before I made my tacos. So so so so good. I'm definitely making this again.

Loved recipe. Much more flavorful than expected. Did not add tomatoes for fear of making the filling too watery. Cilantro was a tasty addition and loved the queso fresco.

Maybe my tomatoes weren't good enough, but even with a squeeze of lime this was a little dry. I've made better tacos than these!

THIS RECIPE IS QUICK AND GREAT. DID WHAT OTHER REVIEWER SAID, ADDED SQUEEZE OF LIME JUICE AND AVOCADO BEFORE EATING. TERRIFIC.

I used frozen corn and dried oregano but it was still great. Also added avocado like others suggested, and I also added fat free sour cream, which was good.

Simply Delicious! I read the reviews before making this dish and I love fresh tomatoes as well.. however.. the way the tomatoes marinate with the garlic and onions to create a light sauce is absolutely delicious! You wouldn't get those flavors if you put the tomatoes in fresh. I didn't have any green salsa so I used Tapatio and it definitely added a great spicy flavor. I highly recommend this dish. Enjoy!

Used corn cut from 2 cobs; one small red onion instead of white; used only 1 large zucchini (about 2-1/2 cups); and whole can black beans (about 1-1/3 cups). Toasted the corn as indicated and set aside; then sauteed the onion and garlic and also set that aside; then browned the zucchini on its own, only took about 5 minutes (not 10 to 12 as indicated); then warmed black beans on their own. Did not cook the tomatoes -- added them fresh on top and liked the fresh cool contrast with the cooked vegetables. As others suggested, used more cheese and topped with slice of avocado and some cilantro. Really refreshing and tasty.

Yum! Added a bit of cilantro on top and lime as some other people had suggested. This was perfect! Put a slice of fresh avocado on top of each taco too. Will make this again for sure! I think I could have thrown in a few other vegetables too depending on what was in the fridge.

I made this without tomato because I didn't have any on hand. The toasted corn and crisp tender zucchini (don't over cook it) were well seasoned with oregano, garlic and onion. The zucchini helps to release the corn bits from the pan. Very good. I think I'll try the same filling in an enchilada casserole.

This is a great simple and quick recipe that can be made in one pot/pan. Used red onion instead of white and just whatever salsa we had on hand and they were yummy. I added avocado to mine as well. Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe exactly except I made my own salsa and a pumpkin seed sauce for on top. Wonderful!!! I'm a big time meat eater and I didn't miss the meat at all. Loved it!!

good as a taco and as a side ... though I really upped the seasoning to get the kind of kick and robust flavor preferred in our house

This is a very nice, fresh meal. The tomatillo salsa really enhances the flavors. I didn't add enough zucchini and the flavor was a bit overpowered by the beans & corn. I think fresh cilantro and maybe some lime juice might be nice next time.

This is excellent and healthy. We've had it numerous times now and served it for friends as well. A keeper!

Great base recipe for summer veggies, but pretty bland as is. Added an habenero, chili powder, and cumin for added flavour. Would recommend seeding the tomatoes - otherwise the recipe is too soupy to use as a taco filling. The zucchini did not add anything to the dish. Next time, I will omit it and substitute more tomatoes instead.

This was great! So very veggie. The corn crusted the pan and the tomatoes deglazed it! Brilliant-- But who ever heard of 1 tsp of cheese on a taco? You'll want more....

Wow! This was so fresh and flavorful. What a great summer supper. No need for the tortillas or cheese if you don't happen to have at the time - it's great on its own. I wonder how it'd taste with a bit of lime juice over the top?.

This was very delicious and easy to make. Leftovers were great the next day! I will definitely be making this again.

Simple, healthy and delicious recipe. I did not add the tomatoes; instead, I added cumin, cayenne, and red pepper flakes to taste (I like spicy food). I also omitted the cheese and tortilla. I'll definitely make this again.

This is an amazingly delicious recipe that I made as is written -- to a point. Although not listed in the ingredients, the preparation tells you to "add tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes". Because I didn't know how many tomatoes to add and in what form, I added 3 roma tomatoes, diced and cooked them for the 10 minutes as noted. It turned out great so I will do that from now on. This is truly a keeper and I will be doing this meal regularly.
