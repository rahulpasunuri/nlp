As previously stated, "bacon is not crackling" and the recipe is "misnamed". I'm a Yankee and I've eaten Crackling Corn Bread years ago and it certainly wasn't made like this.

I'm a lifelon Yankee and even I know that calling this recipe "crackling cornbread" is heresy. Heresy, I say! I carved a bunch of the fat off our Christmas ham carcass, chopped it into little bits, rendered it, drained the resulting cracklings and proceeded as the recipe says, using about half the specified grease. It was still not quite authentic, but successful nonetheless.

Bacon is not cracklings so the recipe is completely misnamed. In any case, save the bacon fat for hamburgers. This is lousy.

Cracklin Corn Bread? Bacon bread is more like it... my mom is 87 years old from Alabama and thought this was a joke. The creator of this recipe had to be a Yankee.

This recipe is not cracklin' cornbread!! Where are ya'll from? Obviously not the SOUTH where cracklin cornbread originated. Crackling Cornbread is made from cracklings not bacon. Get your recipes straight!

I don't know what Ginger Adams did, but this was reprehensible. I'd like to say I think I made it wrong, but I didn't--I was apprehensive about this recipe from the beginning; just look at the ingredients list! What is in it to give it any flavor? I'll tell you: bacon grease. It tasted overpoweringly of bacon grease. You couldn't even taste the bacon for the grease. Nasty!!!

Not the cracklings my grandmother used in her cornbread....better!! This is a wonderful recipe. Easy and delicious.
