This was pretty good. Aside from a small amount of prep work, this came together pretty quickly. I made this to recipe with the exception of doubling the garlic (personal preference) and using roasted peppers in place of the yellow pepper, as that is all I had. I think I will use roasted peppers next time too. I liked the flavour and texture. I used about 3/4 tsp cayenne and the rice had a bit of a bite to it. It was the perfect amount of heat. The flavours came together nicely and it looked great. I will definitely make this again.

I used brown rice, and I had to cook it for almost one hour... But the taste is very good, and it's got a nice kick... Only used 1/2 tsp cayenne, no scallions, and skipped the butter. I'm thinking that this would be a really yummy all-in-one meal if I added some pieces of chicken breast before sending it to the oven...

This is so good, I can't stop eating it. Making it today and I keep going back for more forkfuls. Something about turmeric makes me want to keep eating. One thing I must warn you about is the BURNING eyes I experienced while cooking this in my small apartment. At first I thought it was onion eyes, but I realized after a while it was the cayenne. The fumes were so strong, I had to open a window and sit next to it while it baked! I used regular medium grain brown rice so cooked it a bit longer. Again, it is delicious.
