I doubled the peas and water and added carrots and celery. I also added 3 cloves of garlic with the peas, onion, water and ham bone then sauteed 3 minced cloves with the onion and leeks. Delicious. Will definitely make this again.

This soup tasted fantastic, though I changed a few things... I used yellow split peas and found that they became mushy in much less time than stated in the recipe. My soup was ready in 2.5 hours. I was too grossed out by the ham hock in the supermarket (squeamish ex-vegetarian) so settled on the salt pork. I wish the salt pork I found had been less fatty and more meaty as the recipe suggests. Like another recipe suggested (wish I read the reviews before hand) the result was some unappetizing looking fatty pork chunks floating around. My solution was to stick everything in the blender once the soup was cooked. This resulted in a creamier colour and delicious even texture. I omitted any salt as the pork was salted, and this was sufficient for my tastes! Next time will try a meaty ham bone if I can find one!

Delicious soup and an excellent way to use up left over New Years ham (meaty bone). A couple comments: I doubled the recipe and used split green peas (because that is what I had in the cupboard) and they took twice as long, if not more, to cook down to the mushy stage at the end. This was no problem because I just kept the pot simmering away on the stove for the evening. Secondly, do not be afraid to top up the pot with water as you go along. I did this (probably added at least an additional 1.5 litres of water) throughout the process and the end result was a rich, thick and flavourful. My third and final comment is that I did modify slightly at the beginning - I added in 3 diced carrots and sweated the carrot and onion at the beginnng with a bay leaf and a sprinkle of dry thyme. I have put half in the freezer.

Loved this. Used a ham hock. Didn't have any savoury, so I threw in a bit of cumin, celery salt, some fresh herbs from the garden, and it was superb!

FABULOUS! We used our Easter HoneyBaked Ham Bone and all the freshest ingredients, like others here we did add diced carrot (2) it was wonderful. The timing however was confusing, for us (cooking in a cast iron dutch oven) it took just under an hour and the peas were soft almost mushy, then we added the veggies and cooked for perhaps 45 minutes it was PERFECT. Seasoned nicely with NO ADDITIONAL SALT! We will make this again and again on a cold rainy night like this!! Chris & Paul

This soup is delicious and so easy to make. Definitely use a ham hock - it adds the incredible flavor to the soup. I had never used a ham hock before, and will never make this soup again without a ham hock. Added some carrots and Italian Seasoning but followed recipe other than that. Don't forget the fresh chives - worth it! Nice color and texture. No stock needed; just add water as the recipe says. Healthy too - barely any fat rose to the surface using the ham hock and the meat was so tender and delicious.

Wonderful soup! I did add some Turmeric and a bayleaf, really adds nice taste and color. Topped with fresh parsley. A family favorite!

The recipe is perfect as it is written. I did toss in a few sprigs of thyme when the sauteed vegis were added to the mix. You can always add chopped up ham for a higher protein value. I thought this paired nicely with Red Bicyclette Chardonnay.

We read some of the reviews, added a bay leaf, fresh thyme, and 1tsp sugar and about 2 carrots diced. This was the best split pea soup I've ever had. It was AMAZING. We're definitely making this again.

I had split peas in my kitchen, and purchased a ham hock. Never used one before. For everyone who have not - be warned - it provides great flavor, but it very, very smokey. I am not crazy about it. I think it would be more successful to use a ham bone instead. This recipe is also very similar to French Canadian Pea Soup. I wish I had seen this video prior to embarking on a 2-3 hour soup-making venture, with mediocre results.

This was very simple and a very tasty way to use an Easter ham bone. I used green split peas, added some fresh thyme sprigs and a fresh bay leaf in addition to the savory and fresh chives. I caramelized the second half of the onions, the leeks, and some diced carrots in a little bit of bacon fat, and added the subsequent bacon bits as a topping when serving. Also added a spoon of sugar. Overall very pleased!

Delicious and very flavorful, but mine was decidedly over-salted (having followed the recipe). Next time I will use half the salt and then season to taste. I used salt pork as my market didn't have any ham hocks available. I would order the ham hocks next time; the salt pork was just too fatty to be appetizing. Like others, I used thyme in place of savory, and added a bay leaf. I also added 2 extra cups of water. But despite these tweaks this soup is definitely worth the effort!

I like this recipe although the ham hock was a little much for me...but it did give a lot of flavor to the soup. I found the soup lacking in herbs...it needed 'something'. I used Thyme instead of Savory, added chopped carrots and left out the chives (didn't have those on hand). Still was a great soup, but not spectacular. P.S. When re-heating, try adding water/chicken stock as it gets very dense after it cools.

I don't even like this kind of soup, but using some of the suggestions made by other reviewers (thanks!) I think this is actually a split-pea soup I will make again. I used water, not stock, added 1 tsp sugar, a bay leaf, a handful of diced carrots, and thyme instead of savory (didn't have it), and skipped the chives (ditto). I cooked the leeks and second batch of onions and carrots very slowly, added the sugar to that, so ended up carmelizing the stuff, as someone suggested. The result was sweeter than most lentil-type soups, but with a dollop of sour cream (again, thanks!) it was just right. I did puree some of the soup at the end, which I'm not sure has been mentioned. It sort of looks like gruel, but yummy gruel. Give this a try even if you don't like this kind of soup; it might make you a believer.

Quite good, made as written except for no chives. Used the bone from the holiday ham, used water not stock and everyone in my home is happy.

I found that the soup needed more water during cooking. Like others, I added a few carrots during the saute of the leeks. A good soup and more pleasing to the eye than a green split pea, but not sure I love it as much as other reviewers. My ham bone came from a "Martha Stewart for Kirkland" (Costco) ham, which was excellent.

I used red lentils because I didn't have any split peas. It was still wonderful! I was having guests over for lunch, so I did the first step (lentils, onions, leftover ham and bone from Christmas and water) in the crock pot on low overnight and it worked wonderfully. I only had to finish the soup up in the morning. It was so easy and yummy. I will definitely make it again!

I also used green split peas instead of yellow and thyme instead of savory. The results were excellent.

One word: marvelous! I had some ham steaks in the freezer left over from my New Year's Day black eyed peas. I used two ham bones from those, plus about a half cup of the diced meat. I added another cup or so of the diced ham at the end. We loved the soup with a dollop of sour cream. It's definitely a keeper.

This recipe is wonderful. It's everything you could ever want in a split pea soup. Here were my changes: I used 1/2 lb. split peas, 1/2 lb. red lentils, no leeks (didn't have any on hand), no chives, no savory, and no pork or ham (so it was vegetarian). I also added a bay leaf, a couple branches of fresh thyme and some peeled, sliced carrots. In spite of all my changes, :) the soup was amazing. It really is the best split pea soup--it takes like it came from your favourite home-cooking restuarant. I'll be making it for years to come.

Yummy and so easy. Used a leftover ham bone and some left over chopped ham. Had no leeks. Took others advice and carmelized the second half of the onions (not too dark)before adding them to the soup. Try this with some fresh baked bread on a rainy night. Even the kids will lap it up.

This dish was a new take on pea soup for me as I've always used Green peas. However, it was delicious and special. I didn't use a ham bone or hocks due to fat content, but added some finely cubed ham in the middle of cooking. Also, I added a bay leaf in addition to the savaory (it was delicious!). Our traditional way of serving pea soup is to add a dollop of sour cream or creme fraiche and about a tablespoon of sherry at serving time - and that was the icing on this recipe. The leek/onion/chive combo was also great. Fabulous!!!!!

Used chicken stock rather than water, leftover honeybaked ham, blew off the leeks and used big, lovely yellow onions, which I carmelized and pureed (and which *did* make a dent in the pea taste, though the stock undoubtedly helped). Don't think it needs carrots; but to each his own. I let it cool overnight in the pot and spooned out the oil the next day no problem. Yum!!

This was a very nice nourishing soup. There was a nice subtle sweetness and creamy texture. I cooked it in the pressure cooker in about 30 minutes.

Yum. I've made all sorts of variations on this soup and haven't been disappointed yet. Crispy chorizo instead of ham, added finely diced celery and/or carrots towards the end of cooking, different fresh herbs, etc. Perfect winter food. Even better the next day. Serve with dark, dense bread and a simple salad. Enjoy!

The comment re prayer really convinced me. I had a lovely ham bone(Beeler, uncured, hickory smoked, the leanest ham I have ever seen!)and I followed the recipe to a T except no leaf savory, had to use powdered. Absolutely wonderful. Gave a jar to my Mother & a jar to my boss. Nothing left to freeze. Far superior to dozens of recipes I have tried before. I did add a little extra ham.

I use country ham, leftover holiday ham, or turkey ham in this recipe instead of smoked hocks. I also throw in some diced baby carrots. This is the best soup, and I've never considered myself a "soup person". It freezes well, if you can sneak any of it out of the pot into the freezer for later! Can't wait for winter and soup season again with this recipe!

Great receipe to work with in making a yellow split pea soup...a couple changes as I found worked well for me.... Skip the savory, cause not many have that fresh on hand.... and use a bit of thyme, basil.bay leaf. then .brown ham hocks and saute a bit w/ diced carrot, onion, leek, and I used a bit of diced parsnip, just till tender with the veggies.. add the beans and liquid and let it brew at a nice low simmer for about 4 hours add some diced up ham, either from the hock or some ya have as left over.... and about a teaspoon or so of sugar..bit of salt and pepper to taste and serve w/a garnish of parsley and buttered croutons..wow.. nice soup supper..with a sourdough bread or corn meal muffins for dippin..

Really tasty & not at all difficult to make although I could not find savory at local supermarkets. Here's an excellent use for leftover Easter ham!

Really delicious. I followed directions exactly and the leeks, chives, and savory between them worked some magic. One of few recipes I feel no desire to tweak.

We all enjoyed it. A shortcut of mine does not really alter the end result and that shortcut is 2 minutes in the microwave to soften the onions with butter.

I used two smoked bacon hocks, slit through the skin and baked in a 200C oven for 20 minutes - then threw away the fat and skin. I also added a half cup of red lentils to the basic mixture and tripled the garlic, plus home-made vege stock to replace the water. Fantastic soul food, especially with toasted foccacia bread and some well matured Kalamati olives on the side.

Been years since I made split pea and decades since I added the ham. This is an excellent recipe but for 2 things: 1) Too much fat in that ham bone -- after it has simmered (at about 160 degrees for 1-2 hours) while the peas are still whole, cool and put the whole mess in the fridge so you can skim the congealed grease off the top. I tried to skim while hot, and it was mostly unsuccessful. After this stage, the fat is so incorporated into the disintegrated peas, you just have to eat it. 2) No matter what flavors or veggies you add, the peas will overwhelm it, just like beans. I could barely taste the mass of onions and the leeks just disappeared. I added a T. of pepper flakes and 3 large carrots halfway thru PLUS a handful of lean cubed ham and cup of celery 20 mins before the end , and only the ham made a dent. Fear not, peas taste good!

This is the best recipe for pea soup that I have found. Initially, I was concerned about the large amount of onions, however, they seem to add a complexity of taste rather than over-powering the dish. Also, I used a meaty ham bone which also added a lot of flavor.

This was just delicious. A little salty, so next time I will eliminate the 2 tsp. salt (I made sure to use unsalted butter). Also had 1/2 lb of green splits in my pantry so combined yellow and green. I added carrots too...what is split pea soup without carrots? Very traditional tasting.

Excellent recipe. Nothing is better than French-Canadian "soul food". I'm French-Canadian and this is the first time I've made a better soul-food dish compared to my mom. I used chicken stock instead of water and German "kassler" (smoked pork chops) in the soup. The smokiness really adds zing to this recipe.

Just like mom use to make. I added some bite size carrots though and it is still umm umm good.
