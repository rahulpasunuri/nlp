Just an FYI - Annatto seeds are available by mail order from Penzey's Spices. But as others say, achiote paste is MUCH easier to deal with.

We really enjoyed this. We used Meyer lemons instead of the bitter orange. The local Whole Foods had never even heard of annatto, but lucky for us we have a Mexican grocery store close by. They had several forms, including the paste and pre-ground seeds, which is what we used. No banana leaves, but small foil packets worked great. Served with tortillas, everyone really liked this. We will definitely do this again.

This turned out very good -- I couldnt find banana palm leaves in Montana so I substituted with corn husks instead. If you go with corn husks I would suggest using twine to wrap the chunks of pork. I also added 2 Bell peppers on the top of everything and they tasted great after they carmelized a little under the broiler in the oven. Next time I will increase the amount of spices used to bump the flavor up a bit. Also I highly recommend grinding up the spices beforehand rather than using whole seeds.

Great dish, super easy. I found ground annatto very easily, but then this is Los Angeles. I actually split the meat with 1/2 pork and 1/2 boneless chicken thighs and breasts (cooking only 1 1/2 hours for the chicken). Delicious. Everyone, including kids ate it up. I will definitely make again.

This is delicious, and easier to make than it sounds. The salsa is critical to the success of the dish.

This is one fantastic recipe. I found the achiote seeds through Pensey's spices. We have no banana leaves up here but collard leaves seem to have worked just as well.

This is one of my favorite Mexican recipe. I agree that Annatto seeds are quite difficult to find. I recommend also the Asian grocery, they have some sometimes (used in Thai cuisine). However, you can always go for "Achiote" paste (I think that every Spanish grocery have some). It's basically grind annatto with salt, garlic and some other stuff. Way easier to use than the super hard seeds. I prefer achiote since it's easier to use. For the receipe, you can have a look at the movie "Once upon a time in Mexico" by Robert Rodriguez. The special features show a 10 minutes cooking school and that receipe is amazing. Another place would be the Rick Bayless website. He is the Mexcain cuisine reference.

The flavor really was delicious. However, the annato seeds were very difficult to find and I live in New Mexico with lots of Spanish markets. I finally got them online. Then grinding them up with the other spices was even more difficult. They are like rocks!!! The next time, and there will be a next time, I will have my friend who has an industrial grinder grind the annato seeds and I will either lower the oven temperature or cook for less time get a moister result.

overall, this is a great recipe with rice or tortillas. however, you must bear in mind three things with this recipe. first, you must marinate the pork with the sauce for at least six hours. second, when roasting in the oven, line the bottom of the pan with foil or otherwise, the juice will burn onto the pan. lastly, philosophically, you must attempt to create a pit with a roast pan by sealing it.
