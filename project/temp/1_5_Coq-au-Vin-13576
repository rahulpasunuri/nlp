Mon Dieu ! Personne dans leur bon esprit appellerait le Coq au Vin ! S'il vous plaît enlever cette recette du dossier.

Atrocious! This would end up as a soggy mess. Even though I haven't cooked this, I know enough about cooking to predict how this would end... in tragedy.

Dobson is slamming a person whom he calls a "Frenchman," when that so-called "Frenchman" hails from Brussels, Belgium. Sort of like calling this recipe coq au vin, oui?

This is fine if you have all the ingredients on hand and want to make something quick for two. But I agree with the other reviewers. Please change the name. Don't make an everyday slop dinner -- in the microwave no less -- and give it the same name as one of the most sublime French culinary creations.

Although, admittedly, I did not make this dish and don't intend to due to the use of the microwave (agreeing with most who reviewed this one), I did find it odd that the Dobson fellow had so much negativity directed toward the French fellow when all the French fellow did was to say what just about everyone else (Americans) had to say: this dish shouldn't be cooked with a microwave. I think Dobson's real problem is with the foreigner and he should keep his comments limited to the discussion of this recipe, rather than the so-called technological advances of America. Yes, I am American... and No, I do not like the idea of microwave cooking for most dishes. I'm with Dallas, New York and the Frenchman on this one.

It sounded too quick to come close to this classic French feed...but if its fast chicken your looking for, try the Colonel. Delete this recipe. Or send it to Readers Digest.

All right... I tried this recipe... hmmm... not so great. BUT!!! It did make a decent Tom Kah Gai later with the addition of vegetables, coconut milk and red curry paste.

I am for changing the name. When I go to this sight for a classic recipe, I expect to see the classic recipe. Not that I won't try variations, its just that the title should indicate this.

I notice that those who dislike this recipe had not actually tried it, which seems silly. It seems to be an adaptation of a Barbara Kafka version, which she diplomatically calls something like Chicken in Red Wine. Coq au Vin it may not be, but it's vastly better than the same-prep-time alternative-- heating up a frozen dinner or ordering out. I cooked the Kafka version the other night, and it was on the table in half an hour, along with a risotto, home-made bread and a garden salad. Few Luddite food snobs ate as well that night, in my opinion.

wow...people are really emotional about this. Maybe they should just change the name...it probably tastes good-- just not like coq au vin. who cares? If this is a palatable microwave dish, I don't see why the name should make any difference. Make it, and find out. As of yet, I see no well-founded complaints.

I wouldn't make this recipe. A better choice if you're looking for a "shortcut" is to follow a standard, traditional coq au vin recipe but use rock cornish game hen in place of the rooster. Everything is about the same but the hens need simmer only half an hour or so - I cut them into four pieces and serve two per person. Turns out wonderful!

You don't have to live in Europe to realize that slow cooking on a real stove is essential for traditional dishes like Coq au Vin. What a terrible recipe this is! I do feel bad for anyone who's never had this delicious dish and decides to try this "version" to see. Shame on you, Gourmet! Though we don't all have lots of time, we do still want dishes that taste good; we have come to expect better from you.

Horrid, how can one call that a "coq au vin"

While I haven't a clue what this recipe would taste like, I think I can safely say I would rather eat this than be forced to spend an evening with the Frenchman who wrote the first review. If you don't appreciate American microwave technology, get off my cloud. Some of us want to live the dream, not just look at it from accross the Atlantic. Send us your food and we'll make it better. Personally, I commend the author of this recipe for his/her dedication to the advancement of cooking techniques.

I don't know how you dare to call this recipe a gourmet.I don't think that microwave should be used in cooking at all.This recipe is just a disgrace!!You should just go back to college and study again because you forgot what cooking was all about.Both as a cook and french,I'm very surprised(to not say more)to find this kind of recipe in your site.Let's hope you'll make better in the future?

This traditional dish doe not merit the treatment provided at this recipe. Follow a classical recipe - take your time, use good pork fat back, spend your money on good bottle of burgundy, peel baby onions one by one, marinate it overnight, thicken the sauce with beurre manier. Yes, use a good free range chicken instead of an old cock - but please do not use this degenerated microwave recipe - call it anything else - but not a coq au vin. Note for those even more orthodox than me - you may call my version "poulet au vin". But - done the right way - IT WILL TASTE LIKE HEAVEN!

Come on Gourmet, get your act together. A microwave?

How could you not have a traditional recipe for coq au vin in your files? Who has ever heard of a microwavable coq au vin, who would want to even try this recipe?

This is not Coq au vin. Call it whaterver you want, but when you use traditional and original denominations you must follow the basic rules of cooking. This is very desappointing. When one opens what is called the "Gourmet" section and finds so many errors in the recipy and the preparing.This could be any recipy for any dinner. You did not take consideration that some of your visitors might know something about french cooking and are happy to see sites like yours on the web. One choose one's standard, and impose it, but in this case, please raise it.
