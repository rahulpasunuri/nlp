This is a fantastic recipe. I had sofisticated guests when I did it almost literally (I abunded on the apricots) and they begged me for the recipe. It is time consuming but worth every minute.

how can this be adapted for the slow cooker?

this is a wonderful brisket recipe. I have made it for passover for two years in the row (substituting matzah meal for flour) and it has been a hit. The only change that I make, other than seasoning the sauce after to taste, is I add a can or 2 of diced stewed tomatoes instead of the tomato paste. Similar to other reviewers' observations, I cooked this on lower heat (at 250-300) for 5 hours. I also skip the appricot and pearl onion garnish preferring to simmer the sauce after to thicken it into gravy and just adding extra dried apricots into the sauce directly while its simmering.

This recipe, which is a cross between wine-sauced brisket and the sweet versions with dried fruit that are common for Jewish holidays, is the very best comfort food. I used a 3 lb first cut brisket--not the most desirable cut. I didn't reduce the sauce much--next time I might puree some of the cooking vegetables and use that as a thickener, and I used a family brisket technique: sliced the meet, arranged it in a roasting pan, poured the sauce over, and left it in the refrigerator for a couple of days. Then I reheated, covered, in a medium oven for about 30minutes and added the onion/apricot mixture (go easy on the apricots)toward the end. The meat was fork tender and the sauce simply delicious. Served four with leftovers.

Watch the salt content of your brisket. If you don't but a fresh cut from a butcher and it's pre-wrapped make sure to check the sodium content. If they are above say 10% of your daily value there is no need to add any salt to the recipe or you will have much too much salt.

Made this is the slow cooker for Passover and it was perfect and a huge hit. My mother in law took all of the extra sauce home to use on her plain, left over brisket from the night before!

This was great. I made it as written. I did make it a day ahead of time so that it was easy to remove the fat.

I did everything as stated, and it was delicious and amazing. Howeer, just to simplify things, next time I'll skip the pearl onions and just use 1/2 cup of dried apricots as per the first part of the recipe. There was no need for that extra step.

Not nearly as good as the brisket recipe on this site that utilizes apple cider. While I was eating this I was wishing I had just made the other recipe instead. The apricots need a little more ummph to take this meal to the next level.

I made this for 10 people the other night. I cooked 5 lb.s of brisket in an 8-quart pressure cooker (in two 2.5 lb pieces) for an hour. I used the same amount of wine as the recipe called for but only 2 cups of broth. I forgot about the tomato paste -- I was going to add it after cooking -- but 1 Tbs might have been a nice addition. I didn't reduce the sauce at the end -- it was pretty thick and intensely flavored. Otherwise I followed the recipe. It was falling-apart tender, and delicious.

Overall I loved this recipe, BUT the 3 hours of cooking is just not enough to get fork tender meat. I think lower and slower... although I haven't worked out how low or how slow, yet. :) Next time. Also - love the apricot and onion garnish. I think i would brighten the gravy/sauce with a splash of wine at the end to brighten it a bit and balance the apricots a bit. Good recipe though. Will definitely be giving it another go.

We have made this brisket twice now and we're making it again for Passover this year. Each time, we follow the recipe exactly as it is and all goes well. We don't prepare in advance, and only time it to be ready when dinner is served. Have paired it with the leek matzoh ball soup which went over really well although my husband did question it at first.... Each time, family and guests have raved about the brisket and none of it ever remains when the party ends. Highly recommend it!

I made this brisket last night for 15 people for Passover and it was awesome. The best brisket Ive ever made. Heres what I did (incorporating other peoples recommendations). For 15 adults and 1 child I made 9 lbs of brisket (one 5 lb brisket and two 2 lb briskets). I made the 5 lb brisket in my oven in a dutch oven at 275 degrees for 7 hours overnight (set the oven timer to turn off automatically). I made the two smaller briskets in my slow cooker overnight for 8 hours on low. I sautéed all the veggies in the dutch oven and then separated them between the oven and the slow cooker. I pureed the veggies from the briskets and added them to the reduced sauce. This was delicious. In the morning, I cooled and sliced them, put all the meat in the dutch oven, poured the sauce over it and put it in the fridge. - When the guests arrived at 5 PM, I put the dutch ovenin the oven at 300 to reheat. At 6 PM, we took the brisket out of the oven and put it on the counter to cool a little bit while we finished the service. It was in perfect shape to put out on a serving platter just before we ate our main course.T he night before, I made the apricot/onion side. I then put it in the fridge and reheated it on the stove while I plated the brisket. Overall I thought this brisket recipe was easy and delicious.

It was in perfect shape to put out on a serving platter when we we ate our main course.

I made this last night. Wonderful! The reductions are the key, I am sure. I did not have pearl onions, so substituted a large sliced onion instead, no problem with that.

Fantastic! I followed the recipe but did not reduce the sauce or make the pearl onions. Still came out great. Will make again for sure.

I made this recipe for Rosh Hashanah dinner last night, and I think it was the best brisket I've ever made (in about a decade of mostly successful efforts). I doubled almost everything (using 2 4-pound brisket pieces), except for the liquid, which I only slightly increased with some broth. Other changes: I left it in the oven for 3 hours at 300, then chilled it overnight. I sliced the meat when cool, then put it back in the oven for another hour at 300 before letting it rest (per Alton Brown). I had chilled the gravy separately, so I could skim the fat, then poured most of it on the meat before the last bake. It was so tender and delicious!!

Too much work for an "only medium good" finished meal. I used 4 pots & pans to make the dish when it could have been done in the slow-cooker with results just as good. Best part was the onions, also the gravy (after I put it in the blender.) The carrots came out mushy and side dishes were required to make a complete meal. I would totally modify this recipe before making it again.

This dish is exceptional! Everyone loved it. I only had beef brisket cubes on hand so I used those, and I didn't have time to get some dried apricots, so I used orange marmalade instead, but it still turned out great. I love how the flavor infuses into the meat, every bite is a burst of flavor. Btw, after it was cooked, I took out the beef pieces and the carrots and mushed the rest of the sauce and veggies through a sieve to get the flavorful sauce. Definitely a keeper!

This was an absolutely fabulous dish! Made it for the first time almost exactly as the recipe said with a slightly smaller brisket (3 1//4 lbs) and couldn't ask for a more perfect meal. Rave reviews! After reductions and straining, the sauce was absolutely incredible! It is going nto one of my all time favorites files!!

I made this dish NYE for DH and our friends. It turned out to be such a wonderful dinner! I do not have a dutch oven, so I thought about the crock pot (since I used it earlier in the week for braised short ribs). However, the 5 lbs would not fit, so I improvised using my 9x13 dish, covered in foil, then placed a cookie sheet on top (added a brick for weight). I also cooked as suggested by previous reviewers at 275 degrees for 4 hours. You must reduce the excess liquid over high heat and strain it to make a tasty gravy!

I wanted to adapt it to a weeknight recipe and did it in a pressure cooker, which I cannot recommend. The meat came out well, but the sauce lacked depth and roundness of flavor. I'm guessing it really needs the concentration of flavors that comes with slow reduction of the sauce. The onions and apricot side was good - added some balsamic

This receipe is AMAZING! We had 2lbs of brisket, so we cooked for 3-3.5 hours on 250, and it was absolutely perfect. At the end, I took a potato masher and mashed the veggies into the gravy, right in the dutch oven. Great time saver. Enjoy!!!

Loved this brisket, one of the best I have ever made. Increased the amount of pearl onions and sliced apricots as the amount of meat seemed to call for more. After taking the meat out of the pan. I poured everything else into a colendar, pureed all the veggies etc in my processor and added it to the gravy after cooking it down. All that nutrition and flavor and thickens the gravy. Wonderful. Looked as great as it tasted.

I've made this brisket several times with success. We served it for Yom Kippur last night and everyone gobbled it up. If you're not getting the right results, try a different kind of wine, or cooking slower/longer/lower temp, or preparing the dish the day before. I agree there is too much stock leftover. I strained out half of it and reserved for future beef stew. The other half I pureed with the veggies into a sauce since my two little kids don't trust leeks in their native state. : )

Delicious. Followed other reviewers comments: 275 for 5 hours Used frozen pearl onions, thawed. Normally I would not use anything frozen, but this was less work and was just fine for this recipe. This is a great "Make ahead" meal that you can prepare around noon and then just let cook until ready to serve for dinner.

Made this last night. Brisket was tender as can be. Did as others suggested, 275 for 5 hours (last hour I reduced to 250). I also used only 1/2c broth and the wine and that was it. I did not cover the meat in the liquid I just rotated the meat during cooking. I think the sauce was amazing! Great brisket recipe.

Like the cook from Dallas I had a smaller piece of brisket and did pretty much what she/he did. I did cook it ahead, cool and slice and then reheat as per Puck's instructions. My guests all said it was great and I agree. Mashed potatoes are a must with this.

This was delicious! My favorite brisket (sorry Mom). Had a 3 lb brisket so I cooked it at 275 for about 4 hours. Did not flour and sear the meat first. The gravy was so good--my family was drinking it!

Please reduce those forks. I've had much better brisket every time it was cooked for me by a Jewish friend. All my ingredients were top-notch and i followed recipe to the T, but the meat was tough and tasteless. The dogs ended up with it. I suggest checking out other recipes or asking your J friends. Wolfgang doesn't know what he's talking about.

This is a winner. And I can verify some of the suggestions in earlier reviews: 1) I too cooked for 5 hrs @ 275 and it was perfect. 2) I only had to supplement the wine with a small amount of broth. My dutch oven would not even have contained the amount of broth the recipe calls for. 3) I did not flour the brisket before browning as I found it hard to believe that any crustiness this imparted would then survive 5 hours of braising. Also, it's worth relating that I did a 5 lb brisket that I needed to cut into 3 pieces and they were all perfect despite being different sizes.

Rating: 4
This recipe is fabulous! I highly recommend it, although there are 2 changes I would make. There is no need to dredge in flour before searing. The flour is likely to burn. Also - as with many other reviewers - I cooked it at 275 for 5 hours. It was falling apart. The apricots, pearl onions, and gravy made this dish!!

This is the best brisket recipe I have ever eaten! Don't let the length of the ingredient list dissuade you...it's very easy to do. I made this first for a dinner club crowd, and the men were fishing out the scrap meat and saying it would be a sin to throw out the broth. I have made it several times since, all successes! Lower the temp and cook longer...275* for 5 hours is perfect.

Rating: 4
This is fabulous. I agree with a previous reviewer about going easy on the liquid added (the broth, not the wine) and cooking it for a lot longer at a lower temp. I cooked only four pounds and lowered the temp to 325 and increased the time to 4 hours and didn't put in as much beef stock as indicated. The apricots and pearl onions are a must as garnish.

This was absolutely delicious, but I suggest a few alterations. First, the term "braise" as it says at the top of the recipe, means to use a small amount of liquid. Do NOT cover the entire brisket with liquid! The reduced wine, along with the sauteed veggies, is more than enough liquid. Also, dredging the meat in flour is completely unnecessary. Instead of fresh pearl onions, use a bag of frozen ones, and dump them into the wine as it's reducing to "thaw" them out. Remove with a slotted spoon and tne proceed with the caramelization. Do the onion/apricot thing early on, and then put in an oven-proof dish and re-warm prior to serving the brisket. Also, you cannot overcook a brisket, so lower the cooking temp to about 275, and cook for a lot longer. I put mine in at noon, and served dinner around 7pm. Everyone went nuts. Served with pureed cauliflower, which everyone thought was mashed potatoes.

This recipe is well worth any work involved. Cutting up all ingredients in advance will keep you from feeling rushed during the process. I served it with family favorites, "Sweet & Sour Coleslaw", "Out of This World Cucumber Salad" and "Mashed Klondike Rose Potatoes with Parsley". The flavors together were superb! I would definitely make this again.

My family gobbled this up! Loved it. Only drawback was that the leftover liquid didn't thicken as it should have but that can be easily resolved. Will definitely make it again.

Really good receipe for the holidays ( or anytime you have a crowd ) as it can be made ahead and I highly reccomend that you do so.Cooking the brisket the day before allows you to slice it neatly and trim off the fat, which I suppect would be nearly impossible to do when it is hot. A little concerned about it being too salty and unsure of the salt content on beef broth that I was purchasing , I cut down on the salt for the initial seasoning.Used Wolfgang Puck brand beef stock and it was great.Very simple to make with great results and made putting the rest of the meal together a breeze.

Delicious recipe. Brisket is best cooked low and slow, so I adjusted to oven temp to 250 and braised for 4 hours. The meat was incredibly tender. I used home made stock so salt was not an issue with me as it was with a previous poster. Also ended up making a beurre manie to thicken the sauce which worked very well. Recommended, especially for entertaining because you can have it pretty much completed ahead of time.

We eat a lot of brisket here in Texas, so I thought this different take on it sounded great. I wasn't disappointed. My guests loved it, and it would make a great do-ahead dish for entertaining. The pearl onions and slivered apricot garnish was beautiful. The accompanying spatzle was messy and time-consuming, but really delicious. I do alot of cooking and it's fun to try something truly new to me. Thanks, Wolf!

Even though the ingredient list is long, this was a pretty easy recipe. Results were mixed, though. The brisket was very tender and sliced easily, but was a little on the salty side. The sauce is quite lovely, but the sweetness of the dried apricots in the garnish got a little lost. If I make this again I would probably cut down on the amount of Kosher salt used in the seasoning rub and/or use low-sodium beef stock.
