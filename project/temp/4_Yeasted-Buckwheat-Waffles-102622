I followed the recipe exactly, but added 1Tbs vanilla extract. They had excellent texture.

I used this recipe to healthier low gluten belgium waffles. I used oat flour instead of wheat flour. I replaced the sugar with maple syrup. instead of 1/2 teaspoon baking soda I used 1 teaspoon of baking soda. I added a little bit of vanilla extract, blue berries and cinnamon.

These waffles are DELICIOUS. I didn't have milk, so I used vanilla soy milk, and it worked out great. The subtle vanilla flavor was very nice. My family loved it. Wonderful recipe. Total keeper.

Really nice texture. I used whole wheat pastry flour. Plus it was nice that most of the work was done the night before and it made a pretty big batch.

I already started the recipe when I realized I only had a half cup of allpurpose flour. So, I used that, the buckwheat, half cup whole wheat, half oat flour. I really expected the worst, but the waffles are surprisingly great and fluffy. Normally I'm not a fan of whole wheat recipes, but I am ready to repeat this recipe even when I have the right ingredients.

These were fantastic waffles. When they were cooking they gave off a yeasty aroma which reminded me the rich scent of hops. I served them with homemade butter blended with sea salt and wildflower honey. Maple syrup somehow overshadowed the intense flavor of the buckwheat so I stuck with the butter after the syrup attempt. I would say that the batter lasted a good 3 days in the 'fridge. It might last longer with the addition of more sugar (presumably giving the yeast something to feed on).

I've made this recipe as is, and also once with whole wheat flour instead of buckwheat. Both were really yummy! The buckwheat gives the batter a strange consistency, but they bake up wonderfully.

We make these all the time. Let the waffles cool completely, wrap well, and freeze. They reheat great in the microwave or toaster and are so much better than Eggos. A weekend breakfast on a weekday!

My husband and I loved this...great with blackberry or cherry syrup!

This might be the best waffle recipe I have tried so far. They tasted light and crisp, like ice cream cones.

I had some leftover waffles from the previous day. Having to refrigerate them, the waffles lost its crispiness exterior. I put my day-old waffles in a wide-mouth toaster and my waffles got just as crispy as the day they were made. Amazing and deliciously light and crispy. They are so good and no waste for leftover waffles.

The first time I made this, I substituted buckwheat flour with whole-wheat flour. Whole-wheat flour was not a good substitute for the buckwheat flour if you want airy, light on the inside, crispy on the outside waffles. The second time I made this, I used buckwheat flour as specified and the texture was very light and crispy. Both times I used butter instead of canola oil. This recipe is equally as good as the "Raised Waffles" in this website, but a bit healthier. Next time, I may experiment to substitute spelt flour for the white flour to make it healthier as an earlier reviewer recommeneded. I will post my reviews afterwards.

I made this recipe without the buckwheat...in other words, I replaced all the buckwheat flour with plain unbleached flour. I went with using butter rather than oil (health wasn't my objective here) and let the batter rest at room temperature overnight. It was fantastic. They were the perfect waffle: crisp and slightly chewy, with a rich yeasty aroma. Plus, they are just as good after freezing and reheating in the toaster.

This dish yielded perfect waffles! I halved the recipe (I was only making them for 2 people) and replaced the white flour with spelt flour (which is supposed to be healthier). I also threw in a few chocolate chips for good measure! Yes, it does take a bit of extra effort in preparing the dough the night before, but it wass more than worth the extra investment & planning. Regardless, the waffles were perfectly fluffy and delicious. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Excellent. But check out the yeasted waffles in the March 2004 Cook's (cooksillustrated.com) which are equally delicious, easier, and require no additional steps in the morning. I made the Cook's version with oil instead of butter; in it and in the Epicurious/ Deborah Madison recipe I used a mixture of white, whole wheat, and buckwheat flours plus wheat germ and ground nuts. Cooksillustrated.com charges a flat monthly rate for their recipes (they accept no advertising) but they're well worth it.

These were great waffles. I was afraid they might be heavy but they came out very fluffy and nicely crisp on the edges - excellent. I've recently come into posession of a belgian waffle maker so I've been going waffle crazy! So far I've only tried an aunt jemima whole wheat mix and an arrow head mills blue corn mix both of which really paled in comparison to this from scratch recipe. I curious to try it again with skim or soy and less oil to make it a little bit healthier.

These are fabulous with the right kind of belgian waffle maker--crispy on the outside and chewey on the inside. We had this old cheap flat one, and these came out of the machine flat and soft (but light and tasty). But then we bought a new quality REAL belgian waffle maker, and they're perfect! I love the convenience of being able to do most of the work the night before. You can use whole wheat in place of the buckwheat flour, and I add 3 tbs. flaxseed meal to make it even more healthy. These are my husband's favorite waffles. I make a batch and freeze the leftovers, toasting them in the toaster oven individually as desired.

Delicious waffles, nice and light even with the buckwheat flour. Something different to try, will make them again.
