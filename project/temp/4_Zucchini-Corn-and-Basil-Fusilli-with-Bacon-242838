Absolutely delicious! Made the pesto from scratch with all the basil from our garden. Followed some of the other readers and sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease. Great decision. You never can have too much bacon! And added seasonal cherry tomatoes at the end for a little more color and flavor. I also didn't add all the pasta water at the end. Think it was maybe a full 1/4 cup. I didn't want to dilute the pesto too much. My husband couldn't stop raving about it. I think we both ended up eating too much!

This is so good! My husband is not a fan of veggies but went back for seconds. I followed the recipe as written and found that once I added the pesto, I didn't need any of the pasta water. Great easy weeknight meal for summer.

My husband and I loved this-- a great, fast weeknight dinner! I am rating the dish 3.5 stars with the additions that I made. I wanted to add some more protein, so I sauteed chicken breast strips in the bacon grease (added S&P), and then followed the previous reviewers' advice & added some white onions (about 1/3 C), 2 garlic cloves (finely diced), and white mushrooms (used 5) to the zucchini/corn mixture, and then sauteed all of that in the rest of the bacon grease for a couple minutes. I also added a fresh heirloom tomato (diced) at the end for more veggies, some salt (I don't add as much salt to my pasta as this recipe calls for), and lots of parmigiano! I also used less pesto than called for (probably about 3 oz/4 large spoonfuls) so that it wouldn't overpower the bacon (I didn't have 6 slices--only 3). Also used penne instead of fusilli since that's what I had on hand. We loved it and will definitely make again--would use all 6 slices of bacon if I have it, and probably add 2 more cloves of garlic, but other than that it was definitely a make-again recipe! I have a Moosewood Cookbook recipe for a lowfat pesto that uses tomatoes in place of the oil and most of the pinenuts, so I might try that next time...I think the extra tomato flavor would go nicely with this dish. Thanks for a great quick meal!

I love this recipe. It's fast and easy and makes the best of seasonal produce. I made it several times last summer, using the suggestion to fry the veggies in the bacon grease. Result: wonderful. However, I just made it for the first time this year using a different brand of jarred pesto that I hadn't realized was much wetter (more oil) than last year's jar. Result: still yummy... but greasy. I hadn't changed anything else about the recipe, so next time I'm going to try boiling the veggies with the pasta like the recipe suggests when I use the oilier pesto. In short: I suggest that if your pesto is thick and dry (doesn't run off the spoon), saute the veggies with the bacon. If your pesto is thin and oily, don't.

Two and a half forks for a solid midweek dinner. Following suggestions, I sauteed some onion and garlic in a bit of bacon grease and added before the bacon. I agree the vegetables shouldn`t be sauteed but just briefly cooked to retain their crunch. If I do this again, I will either half the pasta or double the veggies. This can be played with, ie, I would leave the corn and zucchini and experiment with adding other veggies in. Btw, a pound of pasta made a ton; we have lots of leftovers. I won`t salt the water as in the recipe next time because you add a half cup back in, and the recipe doesn`t need that salt. I have salt burn on my tongue now.

this was easy and delicious. As per previous reviewers I sauteed the veggies in bacon fat. Added: Half sweet onion and couple garlic cloves; traded some of the zukes for mushroom; and added a package of tj's chicken jalapeno sausage. Made pesto the night before. I added the pesto slowly, so it lightly coated the ingredients. therefore, flavors were somewhat intact. Husband approved!

This was so easy and so good. My family doesn't love zucchini, so I subbed about half the volume with chopped button mushrooms. Instead of boiling the vegetables, I sauteed briefly in the bacon grease (keep them slightly crunchy), then removed the veg and seared a few diver scallops in the same drippings to place on top. I think prawns would work well, too. If you don't add them, it's still a wonderful dish. I've made this recipe a few times now, and high-quality bacon makes a difference. Not to knock Oscar Meyer, but when I used Niman Ranch bacon, it elevated the dish several notches.

I love this recipe. I recently made it from some friends who never fail to look at me like I have two heads when they first see what I made for dinner. They then proceeded to consume essentially the entire pot. I have to disagree with the reviews below about sauteeing the vegetables: in my view, the olive oil in the pesto and the bacon dripping residue is sufficient grease, and the thing that really makes this recipe POP for me is the crisp-tender corn and zucchini that comes from the 2 minute hot water bath. I also think the bacon is a key element - once I forgot the bacon and got a hum drum response from my dinner guests. Can't wait to make this again and am impatiently waiting for my garden basil to grow big enough to start making pesto since last year's supply ran out

Rating: 3
I would give 3 1/2 if I could. Easy and good. Used the first zucchini from my garden. I didn't make pesto, just used fresh basil, a little olive oil and cheese. Also added diced tomatoes. I make something similiar with a Southwest flavor. I use pasta, bacon, summer squash, corn, tomatoes, and chiles, with cilantro tossed in when serving. The Italian flavors are a nice variation.

My husband and I have made this a few times and enjoyed it each time. The first time, we made it the night before a camping trip. It was delicious as a cold pasta salad and also heated up with dinner.

When removing the bacon drippings, be sure to leave about 2-3 tblsp in the pan. Use this to saute your veggies. It will turn out much more flavorful than if you use olive oil.

Rating: 4
This turned out wonderful! I doubled the bacon, used 2 cups frozen corn (thawed) and a pint of grape tomatoes (halved) and a chopped onion. Adults and children alike loved this meal. I served it with french bread covered with butter, garlic, sauteed mushrooms and mozzarella cheese. Oh, and a side salad. I'll be making it again soon.

I dreamed about this recipe until I actually made it. I made a fresh pesto using the "basil pesto" recipe here on epi. After making the fresh pesto, boiling corn, frying bacon, sauteing veggies, making pasta...geez, this recipe took me like 4 hours to make. In the end I found I tripled the bacon called for...just not enough to distribute the bacon flavors in the pasta. It tasted good but i didn't find it was worth all the effort that went into it.

Rating: 4
Another satisfied customer, but with the caveat that you follow the additions posted in the comments. I cooked the bacon, then sauteed the corn and squash (I used summer) along with 2 shallots and some green onions in the bacon grease. Once the pasta was done, I combined the pasta with the veggies, added my homemade pesto and some cheese, and it was fantastic! A great way to use up those summer CSA veggies.

We just made this recipe and it was a huge success. After reading the other reviews we used the bacon drips to cook the vegetables, and used the pesto recipe posted by one of the reviewers above. This is definitely the way to go, it brings a whole new depth to the recipe! I will definitely be making this one again!

so easy and delicious. following the suggestions of previous reviewers, i sauteed the vegetables in the bacon fat, and added a chopped onion. i think adding a tomato for color would be nice too, which i'll do in the future.

Rating: 4
Quick, easy, and delicious = winner! I cooked the bacon first, and then cooked the zucchini and corn in the drippings. (Because in my book, good bacon drippings should never go to waste!) Added cooked pasta, pesto, and cheese and done! Didn't have fusilli, but subbed penne, and it was equally as good.

Rating: 4
I used whole wheat pasta instead of regular, and this recipe was out of this world good! I found that grinding a bit of celtic sea salt over a dish of this just before eating made all the flavors really pop at the table. Without the salt, it seemed bland. This is coming from a girl who usually salts nothing. This will become a favorite for us.

Rating: 4
I did a combo of the printed recipe & other reviewers suggestions...cooked a diced vidalia onion in about a tablespoon of the bacon drippings, added the chopped zucchini & corn (plus a summer squash that needed eating) to the saute pan - cooked all til crisp and tender & tossed with whole wheat fusilli. I had tons of basil fresh from the garden (but no time to make pesto) so just chopped that & tossed it in with some good olive oil & parmesan. Topped with lots of fresh ground pepper. This was a hit - my husband deemed it "farmers market pasta."

P.S. I think that might be an epicurious basil pesto recipe...

This is an incredibly fast and satisfying meal. I found that the flavor of the pesto is crucial to this simple dish. I made some of my own pesto with basil from the garden (see easy recipe below) to terrific results. My only critical comment is that with sufficiently delicious pesto the extra kick of flavor from the bacon is unnecessary. It actually made the dish a bit too heavy for me. My boyfriend however thought the bacon was a delicious addition. In short, if you're using store- bought pesto I'd stick with the bacon but maybe use a bit less. I recommend this satisfying, quick recipe; especially if you're trying new ways to use abundant garden zucchini! Pesto: mix together in a blender until smooth: 2 cups fresh basil leaves, 3/4 c. parm cheese grated, 3/4 c. olive oil, 3 garlic cloves, 1/4 c. pine nuts. If you're low on basil leaves try substituting the last 1/2 c. with chopped zucchini and a large pinch of oregano leaves.

Delicious! I follwed the advice of other reviews and sauteed the veggies in the bacon grease, which definitly added a little something. I also doubled the amount of pesto and added a carmelized onion, since otherwise there really isn't enough flavor. Will definitly make again, very easy and we loved it!

you'll notice the recipe has a duplicate paragraph and missing one as well. Here is the exact recipe from gourmet.com: * Cook bacon in a 12-inch heavy skillet over medium heat, turning occasionally, until crisp. Drain on paper towels; discard drippings from skillet. * Meanwhile, cook fusilli in a pasta pot of boiling salted water (3 tablespoons salt for 6 quarts water) until al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta-cooking water, then add vegetables to pasta in pot and cook, partially covered, 2 minutes (water will stop boiling). Drain. * Add pasta with vegetables to skillet along with pesto and 1/4 cup reserved cooking water and toss. Season with salt and moisten with additional cooking water if necessary. * Top with crumbled bacon and a generous amount of freshly ground pepper.

Nice and easy summer recipe, I enjoyed the crunch of the corn in there. Mine lacked a little flavor, which I will blame on the pesto, but next time I will definitely add some garlic and maybe onion as well.

Great quick recipe to have in your arsenal. And really, who with a garden does not have some zucchini to burn off every now and again? Great in the summer when everything is fresh and also tasty come winter with frozen corn subbing in. Substituting pancetta for bacon kicks the flavor up a notch.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was a HUGE HIT!! I also made some adjustments. I added 4 minced cloves of garlic and 1 whole onion. I sauteed all veggies in bacon drippings. I also added fresh cherry tomatoes. Lots of fresh ground pepper! I will for sure make this again! Great, easy weeknight meal!

this is my favorite weeknight pasta recipe. i've made it 4 times now. I also sautee the corn + zucchini, and add a little onion. One more change--I cut the pesto amount in half and balance that out with some cream. not as healthy, but the little bit of creaminess adds a delicious and rich layer.

We used proscuitto instead of bacon, and tomatoes too, and I agree it was good, but lacked a little something flavour-wise when hot. This is DELICIOUS, though, as a cold pasta salad for lunch the next day...

Great simple recipe. The only thing I did differently was to saute the zucchini and corn instead of putting it in the pasta cooking liquid. I just prefer the golden color and flavor sauteing gives the veggies over just boiling them. Will make again!

What a delicious way to use all that zucchini from my garden. I LOVED this pasta and it was easy and fast to make. I accidentally drained the pasta too soon but it all ended well. Could also work well with diced proscuitto instead of bacon. I served it with the romaine and balsamic salad. I'll make this one again and again.

We loved this recipe... after a few minor adjustments. I tried it as printed but thought it was just a little bland for me so I added: a container of low fat cottage cheese, several shakes of Johnny's Garlic Spread (from Costco), an 8 0z. bag of Italian Cheese Blend (mozzarella, provolone, parmesan, asiago, fontina & romano cheeses) and a little more liquid. I then baked it in the oven for about 20 minutes covered and about 5 uncovered. Finally, I put diced fresh tomatoes on top. It was delish! Next time we want to add chicken or shrimp too!

Really simple and delicious. I made the "basil pesto" recipe on this site to go with it (doubled the garlic. Because I am a garlic fiend). This is a perfect dinner after a trip to the farmer's market: fresh sweet corn, zucchini, basil. I will continue to make this recipe throughout the summer.

Delicious. We made this as written but topped with tomatoes, bacon and parmesan. We have made twice and substituted the zucchini with yellow squash, which was also very good.

Mmmmmm, very delicious and a big hit with my family. However, I did not like the idea of boiling the vegetables, especially the zucchini. It just did not seem the best way to bring out their flavor and might make the zucchini soggy and tasteless. Grilling is an excellent idea but it was pouring rain here so instead, using a 5 qt sauté pan, I poured off most of the grease from the bacon and simply stir-fried the chopped zucchini and the corn on high heat for not more than 1 or 2 minutes, leaving the zucchini crisp-tender. Then I added the pasta, bacon, and the pesto (Deb Madison's recipe from her vegetarian cookbook). The pesto was made with all Thai basil and that worked very well. I used Raven, Kousa and Sultan zucchinis from our garden and I let them sit for awhile (chopped) on a clean cotton towel to remove some of the excess moisture. These all have tender skin that can be left on if organic, adding additional color to the dish. I think very thick-sliced bacon also works best with this recipe. How wonderful it is to enter what I've picked from the garden that day into the Epicurious database and find wonderful recipes like this one!
