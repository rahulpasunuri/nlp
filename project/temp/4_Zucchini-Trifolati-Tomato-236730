Really good zucchini recipe. I altered it a bit and found my changes improved the recipe. First, I sweated the zucchini for about 30 mins, this helped keep a crunchier texture. Second, I doubled the basil. Also, a slower but better way to make this recipe is to use roasted cherry tomatoes instead of sauteeing them. Oven roast them at 275F on an oiled pan with some salt until they get very wrinkly. It's like candy!

A very easy side dish that goes with almost anything. The only thing I changed was adding crushed red pepper flakes at the end with the basil to amp it up a bit.

I feel silly for not knowing this ... but when it says squeeze out some juice & seeds of the tomatoes, is this to discard or save and add with tomatoes?

Made this as a side for a dinner party last night. So simple and easy to make. And delicious! I'm not a huge zucchini fan but would eat it much more often if it always tasted like this.

This is excellent. Living in England I am very aware of the wonderful cooking of Rose Gray & Ruth Rogers - however, I had to come to my favourite recipe site to find this glorious recipe! And yes, I will make it over and over again - fortunately we have a bumper crop of zukes (known as corgettes here)

This is simple and yet excellent. the flavor of the zucchini really shines through. I cooked it at relatively high heat so next time I would add the garlic a bit later to avoid burning. Delicious.

This recipe was delicious. It brought out the flavors of the vegetables nicely. Our guests were a few minutes late, so I covered this and put it in a warm oven, where it stayed for 20 minutes or so. It still had a good consistency, even after being kept warm. One of our guests commented that he usually does not like cooked tomatoes, and he ate them all!

I have been making a variation of this recipe for years and my family loves it - even the kids! I sometimes add shredded mozzarella at the last moment (hits another food group), covering with a lid to melt the cheese and removing from heat. If you like gooey mozzarella then this option would be for you. Either way, I always offer grated Parmesan and hot chili peppers on the side. A very colourful dish, interesting textures. Once even had a guest who formerly hated zucchini ask for seconds; their partner couldn't believe it!
