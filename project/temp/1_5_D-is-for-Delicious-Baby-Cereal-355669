you really need to blend this very fine in order for it to turn out. I've been making my son's breakfast cereal (started with rice and now he eats a multi-grain variety) for over six months and the only way i've found to get the grains fine enough is to use a coffee or spice grinder.

This didn't work *at all* for me! I ended up with a chunky rice mixture that my baby choked on. It was MUCH easier to put the rice in the blender (not the food processor) after it was cooked, not before.

For some reason I never thought to put the rice in the food processor BEFORE it is cooked! Thanks to this recipe, I'll be saving myself some mess next time. I appreciate the baby-food recipes a lot since I have almost exclusively made my daughter's baby food fresh. (My mother-in-law asked when I was going to feed my daughter the food from the jars. She was confused when I indicated the answer was: Never! ...she doesn't cook much.)
