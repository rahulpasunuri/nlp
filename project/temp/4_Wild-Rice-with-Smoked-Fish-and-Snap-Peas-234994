Rice and fish can always be good spouse in many kitchens. Japan kitchen is an example of these. I want to suggest a recipe from Mediterranian kitchen: Rice and anchovy. http://www.kolaylezzet.com/kolay-yemek-tarifleri/pilav- makarna/125-hamsili-pilav.html

I used a mix of wild rice and other grains that our grocery store had. They don't seem to carry wild rice in MD. Everything was as specified in the recipe except for not having the scallions. Really, really good. Fortunately, my kids wouldn't even try it. :)

It was easy to prepare and i will do it again another time. The sauce was the key to everything. I got excellent reviews on it.

I liked this. It was a refreshing change from the same old. Very different and fresh tasting.I used sherry vinegar instead and reduced the sugar. I also used parsley instead of dill because that's what I had. I think it was fine, dill would have been great too.I think it would also be good with fresh salmon as well.

I would cut the mustard and dill back by half, as they totally overwhelmed all the other flavors. Also, make sure to use pure wild rice only, not a wild rice blend, otherwise it will come out too gummy.

I have made this recipe several times; it is very delicious. I found it was very easy to make for a baby shower I hosted - it was easy to do ahead.

This is in my regular rotation for weeknight dinners. I use plain smoked salmon, and prefer snow peas. I don't mind them crunchy, so to save time I chop the peas in half and mix them in raw.

We thought this was a wonderful, tasty dish and it will definately be made again. Next time, however, we'll increase the amount of dressing to 1 1/2 or double the specified amount. The dish could also use more smoked fish if used as a main. Alternatively, the fish can be eliminated if a vegetarian side is desired.

This is a great recipe to whip up for company or to take to a party.

I have made this several times to take on picnics and everyone loves it. At husband's request, have used 1 part brown rice and 3 parts wild rice; also have increased eggs and smoked trout. We prefer snow peas in this recipe to sugar snaps. This recipe is exceptional and worth the time and expense.

I have made this several times now. I consider four forks ("beyond compare") to be an exceptional level of distinction and this recipe may be that for me. It is spectacularly pretty with its vivid colors, interesting with range of textures and blend of flavors, relatively easy to prepare, and fundamentally healthy to boot! The dressing is a bit too sweet for my taste; I preferred it with about half the amount of sweetness and was happy the time that I used honey. I also use less oil as I prefer to eat very low fat. Bright red grape tomatoes on the side add even more color to the festive presentation.
