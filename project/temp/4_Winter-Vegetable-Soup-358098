This is one of the best soups I've ever made! I altered the recipe by sautéing the onions with chopped garlic and italian sausage. I also diced up celery root and doubled the tomato paste, carrot and celery amounts. I deglazed the onion/garlic/sausage combo with white wine and added 2 heaping TBS of beef bouillon for added flavor. Yum!

Excellent, easy vegan soup! I just finished a bowl of it and will be making it in the future. Definitely an easy soup to make!

What a terrific filling winter soup! I used a yam instead of sweet potato and added in more frozen peas, frozen dill from our garden last year and used an immersion blender for some of it. Served with the skillet corn bread recipe and Italian honey. I always double soup recipes to have for lunches the following week ... it made good portions!

This soup was good - as written. If I make it again, I would add some beans & some sausage, as previously suggested. I added some roasted garlic that was languishing in my fridge. A good soup, very healthy, but kind of an 'everyday soup' ... not 'special'.

This soup is delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except that I find dill to be overwhelming sometimes so I added 1/2 of what is called for. Will make it again.

A wonderful winter soup; pureeing a portion creates a creamy base that makes it more filling. I used a combination of vegetable broth that I had on hand and vegetable Better Than Bouillon. Since I didn't have tomato paste, I used Lizano, a Costa Rican condiment. I served it for a light supper with Curried Pumpkin Bread and my husband raved about it.

I'm not a big soup fan, but this soup has made a convert out of me. I have made it quite a few times. I have substituted a can of white beans for the peas to give it a little more protein and fiber. If I don't have the fresh dill, I us the dried version and add in with the potatoes and other ingredients. I tastes good, but the fresh dill added at the end has a fresher taste.

I have a pretty strong hatred of celery, so I left it out and this soup was still awesome. The dill works really well and wasn't strong like I was afraid it might be.

Yummy and easy vege soup :D

Awesome will definitely be a staple winter soup for us from now on. I 1/2T of Harissa and one whole Roma tomato in lue of tomato paste to make it a bit spicier.

I was surprised - the ingredients seem plain and it is SO easy so I had to try it. I couldn't believe how good it was. The whole is better than the sum of its parts for sure. My only change was veggie broth instead of chicken. Next time I might throw in some beans. Not very filling as a main course soup.

Fessing up front - I changed this around a bit but knew it could be a forgiving recipe. I followed the recipe after adding liquids, put fresh thyme and oregano in a cheese cloth and dropped it in. Didn't plan on using the dill because I already had the fresh herbs and why waste them? I thought the base was kind of bland so I added a few tbls* of "Better Than Bouillon" Beef Base. After processing, I added canned peas, corn, green beans and White Northern Beans. Also added fresh zucchini with the carrot and celery. A sprinkle of parmesan cheese finished it off. *I had doubled everything - the reason for the extra beef base.

Great soup, really tasty. I used two carrots instead of one, and used one healthy sized white potato and one healthy sized sweet potato, and found that I needed more liquid. Used a bit more water and broth than prescribed. While I understand other reviewers' desires for bacon, it's not necessary.

Great flavor and so easy. I omitted 1 tbsp. of oil and did 3/4lb. sweet to 1/4lb. reg potatoes. 5 WW points per serving this way.

Delicious! Easy! I used 1 TBL diced tomato (from a can) because I didn't have any sauce. I also used all sweet potato and frozen spinach (no regular potatoes or peas around). I will make a again and again. I doubled the pepper by mistake; I won't do that again!

This soup is really good, though it might be improved with a little acid (I'm going to try adding some red wine vinegar). Nice and hearty for a veg dish.

This was fast, easy and delicous! I followed the recipe with one exception. I used dried dill (2 TBSP) instead of fresh because I didn't have any fresh dill on hand. I think next time I'll use less Yukon Gold potatoes and a little more sweet potatoes. I can't wait to experiment with this and add some meat like the other reivews suggested. This was also a hit with my boyfriend, he loved it.

Very good soup -- I added bacon pieces to add some flavor, based on previous reviews, and it worked beautifully.

Very nice soup. Not bland at all. Made as written with no substitutions.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. Followed it to a T and it was bland. Even after trying to spice it up it still was nothing to write home about. The recipe for Ciambotta on this site is just as easy and is amazing.

I enjoyed this soup. It was easy to make, healthy to eat. Well, it would have been healthy, but I added pre-cooked, smoked chicken sausage (for my carnivore husband). Excellent. I liked the sweet dill and the savory smoked sausage taste. I omitted the tomato paste and peas on behalf of some persnickety eaters. Still, excellent soup. Highly recommend.

I thought this soup was just soso. its a good base but needs to be doctored up quite a bit.

Great, easy recipe. I modified for my carnivore husband by doubling, substituting chicken stock, and cooking 2 chicken breasts in the stock (then removing, shredding) before adding the veggies. It was a substantial meal on its own with bread, and tasted even better re-heated the next day, for lunch!

Really easy, and so delicious - but not special. Good when pinched for time. Added some frozen corn for kicks - it was great!

I wish I could rate this somewhere between 3 forks (delicious) and 4 forks (exceptional). As it is, following the recipe to a T made an absolutely yummy soup, and because it was such a snap to throw together, I'll definitely be repeating it. The sweetness of the yams / sweet potatoes combined with the subtlety of the dill yielded a fantastic flavor combination, and one I'd like to play with more. Thanks, epicurious :)

I made it exactly as written and thought it was delicious. Don't skip the bay leaf or the fresh dill. They do something magical!!

Very good soup--it was a huge hit with the vegans at our dinner party. DO NOT omit the dill because it really finishes this soup off in a beautiful way, almost giving it a savory/sweet taste. I thought the soup was bland until we added the dill--it just brought the flavors to life. We made this a full day ahead of our dinner party at it was delicious.

Very mild delicious flavor; easy on the digestive system.

super yummy, the puree at the end makes all the difference. added a dollop of sour cream to the bowl after and it was even better

Very tasty soup but next time I'll double the recipe! I'm not a big fan of dill so I subbed 2tsp. of dried thyme. Could not have been better! Crusty bread is a must.

Excellent and easy winter soup. I added a dash of cumin and about 1/2 cup white wine just to enhance the flavor. I doubled the recipe, which was a good thing because most people went back for seconds.

This is excellent, I added more sweet potato and less boiling potatoes. I did not have any tomato paste so I substitued about 1/4 cup tomato sauce with a little flour. Then I used my immersion blender to thicken. Made some herbed biscuits to go with it and a little Rioja from Montebuena. It was a delight.

I made this exactly as written. Wouldn't change a thing- the subtlety of flavor mixed with the earthiness of the texture is great. Beautiful in the bowl too. In a word, delicious.

I made this today due to the 30 degree weather outside. It was very easy and had everything in my fridge except the sweet potato. I just added more russets and it was fine. I also subsituted 1/2 cup of red wine for 1/2 cup of chicken stock. Everyone enjoyed it. I plan on keeping this one for future snowy days and unexpected company. If served with warm bread and it fills you up just fine.
